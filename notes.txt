	...Putin will win on 18 March because the system he created, politely known as “managed democracy”, removes all elements of surprise. His most credible challenger, Alexei Navalny (who in any case did not expect to win), has been banned from participation on specious legal grounds. Last month Navalny was arrested while urging an election boycott.

	...Ksenia Sobchak, who is challenging Russian President Vladimir Putin in next month's elections, says she believes Russian hackers may have interfered in the 2016 US elections and said she was "sorry" if that was the case.

	"It sounds we really had something to do with it," Sobchak told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. "If that's so, I want to say sorry."
	"It's unacceptable for any country to meddle into the affairs of another country," she added.

Duteurte says the motive is to solve "crime and drugs"--maybe it was something different? (if it was, would he even know?)

what's the point of this, to see if he can get away with it? I guess we'll see...


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Drug_War
	The Philippine Drug War, also known locally as the War on Drugs (Filipino: Giyera Kontra Droga, lit. "War Against Drugs"), refers to the drug policy in the Philippines initiated by the Philippine government under President Rodrigo Duterte.[11][12] It has been criticized locally and internationally for the number of deaths resulting from police operations, and alleged summary executions. According to police reports, 3,900 deaths were legal operations and that all of those who died fought against the police force. It was later revealed by both local and foreign investigation groups that more than 14,000 people have been killed in the drug war from inception to March 2017. All deaths allegedly included Filipinos who fought against the police and possessed definite amount of drugs and guns, including teenagers.[13]


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davao_Death_Squad
	According to Amnesty International and local human rights groups, there were over 300 people killed in Davao City by death squads between 1998 and 2005[citation needed]. The rate of killing accelerated after this so that between 2005 and 2008 death squads were responsible for between 700 and 720 executions.[5][6] According to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch, the victims were selected because they were suspected of being drug dealers, child rapists, murderers and other repeat offending criminals.[7][8] Amnesty International states that killings and extrajudicial executions, particularly of criminal suspects, continued throughout the year. In Mindanao many such killings, including those of minors, were attributed to the so-called “Davao Death Squad” vigilante group. It was reported that local officials in some areas advocated a “shoot to kill” policy with respect to criminal suspects resisting arrest.[9]

	Retired Policeman Arthur Lascanas, the self-proclaimed leader of DDS, claims that the group was responsible for mosque bombings and a journalist during their heyday. According to Lascanas, the squad was ordered to bomb mosques in Davao in retaliation for the San Pedro Cathedral bombing.[10]

	...Members of the death squad were managed by either currently serving or ex-police officers, according to Human Rights Watch.[7] These officers provided the assailants with training, weapons and ammunition, motorcycles, and information on the targets. Lists of targets were drawn up by police or barangay (village or district) officials. Information might include a name, address and a photograph and local police stations were allegedly pre-warned to facilitate the murders and escape of the assailants.[7]


supported by ex police officers, I guess pissed at Philipene crime problems


	...Witnesses reported that police officers took a surprisingly long time to respond to incidents even where these occurred in the vicinity of police stations and officers neglected to follow basic investigative procedures, such as collecting bullet casings from the street.[7] Human Rights Watch reported that the standard tactics of the killers was to arrive in small groups of two or three on unlicensed motorbikes. Victims would be stabbed or shot without warning during daytime in public areas such as bars, cafes, markets, shopping areas, jeepneys or tricycles and in the presence of numerous witnesses.[11] Assailants were generally paid between 5,000 and 50,000 pesos (US$114 – US$1,147) for an assassination, depending on individual involved.


sounds like some kind of horrifying experiment


	...Public opinion

	There appears to have been a certain degree of public approval among citizens of Davao City for the actions of the death squad, primarily fueled by public discontent at “the arduous and ineffective judicial system” that created an environment where extrajudicial executions seemed to be a “practical resort” to suppress crime in the city.[11] There were subsequent reports of death squads operating in other cities, including General Santos City, Digos City, and Tagum City in Mindanao as well as in Cebu City, the second largest city in the Philippines.[11]

	Impact on crime
	Crime figures reported by the then-mayor of Davao, Rodrigo Duterte, alleged that crime in the city was significantly reduced during this period. These suggested a decrease in crime from a triple-digit crime rate per 1,000 people in 1985 to 8.0 cases per 1000 inhabitants in the period 1999 to 2005. With this development, survey site Numbeo.com showed that Davao City is world's 4th safest city posting a safety index of 82.64 or a crime index of 17.36.[12] According to police statistics the population in Davao City grew from 1.12 million to 1.44 million between 1999 and 2008 (29 percent)


apparently it worked?

can see how this would be divisive

best solution you'd think would be to clean up law enforcement and justice system, instead dutuerte wants more death squads

one benefit to KGB/mafia types there: without working courts, can accuse opponents and get away with arranging visits with "death squad"

could have practical benefit for them and not just some experiment/proving a point


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Drug_War
	Duterte has benefited from reports in the national media that he made Davao into one of the world's safest cities, and he cites this as justification for his drug policy,[19][20][21] although in reality, police data shows that the city has the highest murder rate and the second highest rape rate in the Philippines.[22][23]


maybe didn't work


	...Following the September 2 bombing in Davao City that killed 14 people in the city's central business district, on September 3, 2016, Duterte declared a "state of lawlessness"


being cheeky on purpose?


	...In the early morning of November 5, 2016, incumbent Albuera, Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr., who had been detained at Baybay City Sub-Provincial Jail for violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, was killed in what was described as a shootout inside his jail cell with personnel from the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG).[75] According to the CIDG, Espinosa opened fire on police agents who were executing a search warrant for "illegal firearms."[76] A hard drive of CCTV footage which may have recorded the shooting of Espinosa is missing, a provincial official said.[77] Espinosa had turned himself in to PNP after being named in Duterte's drug list in August.[78][79] He was briefly released but then re-arrested for alleged drug possession. The president of the National Union of People's Lawyers, Edre Olalia, told local broadcaster TV5 that the police version of events was "too contrived". He pointed out that a search warrant is not required to search a jail cell. "Such acts make a mockery of the law, taunt impunity and insult ordinary common sense." Espinosa was the second official to be killed in the Drug War.[80][81]


started killing officils under suspicious circumstances

"another drug-related death"


	...On November 28, 2016, Duterte appeared to threaten that human rights workers would be targeted: "The human rights [defenders] say I kill. If I say: 'Okay, I'll stop'. They [drug users] will multiply. When harvest time comes, there will be more of them who will die. Then I will include you among them because you let them multiply."


Duteurte keeps saying creepy things


	...On December 5 Reuters reported that 97% of drug suspects shot by police died, far more than in other countries with drug-related violence. They also stated that police reports of killings are "remarkably similar", involving a "buy-bust" operation in which the suspect panics and shoots at the officers, who return fire, killing the suspect, and report finding a packet of white powder and a .38 caliber revolver, often with the serial number removed.

    	The figures pose a powerful challenge to the official narrative that the Philippines police are only killing drug suspects in self-defense. These statistics and other evidence amassed by Reuters point in the other direction: that police are pro-actively gunning down suspects.[85]


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Falcon_and_the_Snowman
	Boyce, an expert in the sport of falconry and son of an FBI office employee, gets a job at a civilian defense contractor working in the so-called "Black Vault," a secure communication facility through which flows information on some of the most classified U.S. operations in the world. Boyce becomes disillusioned with the U.S. government through his new position, especially after reading a misrouted communiqué dealing with the CIA's plan to depose the Prime Minister of Australia. Frustrated by this duplicity, Boyce decides to repay his government by passing classified secrets to the Soviets.

	Lee is a drug addict and minor cocaine smuggler, called "the Snowman," who has frustrated and alienated his family. Lee agrees to contact and deal with the KGB's agents in Mexico on Boyce's behalf, motivated not by idealism but by what he perceives as an opportunity to make money, then eventually settle in Costa Rica.

	...The Falcon and The Snowman received generally positive notices upon release in 1985 and currently has an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes. Film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four-star rating, citing one of the many strengths as that "it succeeds, in an admirably matter-of-fact way, in showing us exactly how these two young men got in way over their heads. This is a movie about spies, but it is not a thriller in any routine sense of the word. It's just the meticulously observant record of how naiveté, inexperience, misplaced idealism and greed led to one of the most peculiar cases of treason in American history."


KGB inconsistent in leniance for drug-related crimes


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Drug_War
	On February 20, Arturo Lascanas, a retired police officer, told reporters at a press conference outside the senate building that as a leader of the Davao Death Squad he had carried out extrajudicial killings on the orders of Duterte. He said death squad members were paid 20,000 to 100,000 pesos ($400 to $2,000) per hit, depending on the importance of the target. He gave details of various killings he had carried out on Duterte's orders, including the previously unsolved murder of a radio show host critical of Duterte, and confessed to his involvement with Matobato in the bombing of a mosque on Duterte's orders.[94][95] On the following day the senate voted in a private session to reopen the investigation, reportedly by a margin of ten votes to eight, with five abstentions.[96]


Duterte crooked?

	The University of Miami doctor who traveled to Havana to examine American diplomats and others who were allegedly victims of health attacks, has ruled out Cuba’s suggestion that the symptoms were the result of mental angst.

	“It is not psychosomatic,” Dr. Michael Hoffer told el Nuevo Herald in reference to the cause that could have provoked physical symptoms suffered by at least 24 confirmed victims over a period of eight months.

	People suffering from psychosomatic disorders develop physical symptoms that are caused by emotional situations such as stress and anxiety. Among the most common symptoms reported by the American victims — which include diplomats, family members and intelligence officials — are headaches, loss of hearing, nausea, fatigue and mild brain trauma.

	Canadian diplomats reported similar symptoms but little information has been revealed of their cases.

got impression they wanted me to apologize to Kelly (think this was it or similar: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kelly-tried-to-keep-his-sons-death-out-of-politics-trump-had-other-ideas/2017/10/17/4b173890-b35b-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html). apologized via listening device on phone for comment before about John Kelly being spy that involved saying curt things about his son's death in military, and after this started seeing articles like this and about kelly


https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/defending-trump-gen-kelly-opens-his-heart-about-death-soldier-n812391

not sure if specific but controversy about "knew what he signed up for" quote relevant (was said roughly in apology)


after that started seeing articles (pretty sure on r/politics and r/politics/new) that incinuated criticism of apology, responded to one that was I think said by a senator

was fredrica wilson (articles about her on call to soldiers widow, not sure which specifically I saw)

article took quote from her and was posted on reddit, said something that I thought was related to what I said, said something into phone to the effect of should honor fallen soldiers and don't make light of it

got impression this started more controversy or activity in media

later saw article by her saying "I am a rock star now" (and apparently calumn brochers didn't like that https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/20/im-a-rock-star-now-frederica-wilson-helped-trump-by-making-a-trump-like-comment/)

other things:

something appeared related to pointing out achenbach sketchy and reporting on brain cancer, appearing after pointed out


remember this https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/19/george-w-bush-trumpism-243945 and similar after comment on Bush and Iraq war protests


took picture of woman on cellphone after being hit from that direction, later saw article saying something like "sexism or PTSD?"

	In 1170, while Henry was in Normandy he lost his temper and shouted 'will no-one rid me of this turbulent priest?'. Four knights took him at his word and they went to England and killed Becket in Canterbury Cathedral. Public opinion was horrified by the murder. Eventually Henry was forced to do penance. He walked barefoot through Canterbury while monks lashed his bare back.
