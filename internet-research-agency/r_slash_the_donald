	@TEN_GOP gained enough support from the far right that when it was finally shut down, commentators like Reddit’s pro-Trump r/the_donald forum expressed outrage. Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump internet activist who himself has more than 213,000 Twitter followers, questioned the action when Twitter temporarily suspended the account in July.

	The subreddit, where posters refer to President Trump as the “God Emperor” and “daddy,” is arguably the epicenter of Trump fervor on the internet. Its membership has grown steadily since the 2016 presidential election, though its members were especially active during the campaign. They mobilized to comb through the hacked Democratic National Committee emails published on WikiLeaks and played a large role in spreading information and theories about those emails. More broadly, they waged the “Great Meme War”: an effort to get Trump elected by bombarding the internet with social-media-ready content promoting Trump or bashing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Some of those memes played on Clinton’s campaign gaffes, such as her use of the phrase “basket of deplorables,” while others involved an emerging pro-Trump iconography centered around images of Pepe the Frog — a cartoon character with a convoluted history that gained especial prominence after it was co-opted by white nationalists as a sort of unofficial mascot. Members of r/The_Donald like to say they “shitposted” Donald Trump into office; regardless of whether the flood of memes swung the election, it did overwhelm the front page of Reddit to such an extent that the site’s CEO rushed to deploy a change in Reddit’s algorithm that limits the influence of any single subreddit.1

	...Since the election, the subreddit has continued to serve as a conduit through which fringe conspiracy theories — often started on sites like 4chan.org, a freewheeling image-based message board best known for creating memes, posting stolen celebrity nudes and birthing the hacker collective Anonymous — enter a larger online discourse. The most striking example has been “Pizzagate,” the false idea that a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C., is the center of a child-trafficking ring involving Clinton campaign manager John Podesta, which prompted a man from North Carolina to “self-investigate” the shop, where he fired a rifle several times and threatened an employee.


r/the_donald organized, active, overlap with 4chan





	r/The_Donald
	– r/politics

	1.r/fatpeoplehate0.275For sharing insults aimed at overweight people (now banned)

	2.r/TheRedPill0.274Virulently misogynistic subreddit, nominally devoted to “sexual strategy”

	4.r/coontown0.266Open and enthusiastic racism against black people (now banned)

	5.r/4chan0.253Screenshots of 4chan.org posts



lol


	...The second-closest result, r/TheRedPill, describes itself in its sidebar as a place for “discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men”; named after a scene from the “The Matrix,” the group believes that women run the world and men are an oppressed class, and from that belief springs an ideology that has been described as “the heart of modern misogyny.” r/Mr_Trump self-describes as “the #1 Alt-Right, most uncucked subreddit” — referring to a populist white-nationalist movement and an increasingly all-purpose insult meant to denigrate others’ masculinity — and the appallingly named r/coontown is the now-banned but previously central home to unrepentant racism on Reddit. Finally, coming in at No. 5 is r/4chan, a subreddit dedicated to posting screenshots of threads found on 4chan, where many users supported Trump for president and where the /pol/ board in particular has a strongly racist bent.


this thing works pretty well

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//r/The_Donald
	Activities by members and moderators of the subreddit have been controversial, and site-wide administrators have taken steps, including an overhaul of the Reddit software, to prevent the subreddit from manipulating the algorithms that select content to be displayed on Reddit's /r/all forum, which the company's motto describes as "the front page of the Internet."[7]


https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13797712/reddit-trump-the-donald-ban
	The news follows controversial actions by Huffman, who admitted last week to covertly editing comments that criticized him, replacing his username in the comments with those of moderators for r/the_donald. The blog post includes another lengthy apology about the incident, but also says the site "cannot tolerate" the group's behavior any more. Huffman writes that the subreddit, which has been known to use the site's "sticky" feature to push its posts up the site's rankings, will have its sticky posts removed from r/all — a major section near the site's front page. (The site will also introduce filtering options to r/all.)


says used "sticky feature" to game r/all

maybe used a bit more than that...



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//r/The_Donald
	The subreddit has been accused by mainstream media outlets of hosting conspiracy theories and content that is racist, misogynistic, antisemitic, or white supremacist.[8][9] FiveThirtyEight referred to it as a "safe-harbor" where racists, white nationalists, and white supremacists press their views.[10] According to The Economist, "few corners of the internet are fouler", and its members "spew conspiracy theories, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism".[11][12]


IRA = the eventual fall guys

MSM = the cheerleaders egging them on...


	History

	On June 27, 2015, shortly after Donald Trump announced his campaign for the presidency at Trump Tower, the subreddit was created to be a place for "following the news related to Donald Trump during his presidential run."[13] The subreddit has grown to be known for frequent posting of memes, especially Pepe the Frog, and frequent use of slang terms such as "centipede" (a reference to a popular Trump highlight reel featuring the Knife Party song "Centipede"),[14][12][15][16] "MAGA," "nimble navigator," "no brakes," "cuck," "4D Chess," and "SJW."[14][17][18] Furthermore, users on the site refer to Trump as "God Emperor."[12] For a significant period of time, the subreddit repeatedly posted an image of Hillary Clinton kissing Robert Byrd, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.[19][20] The image was accompanied by a photoshopped picture of an aged Byrd in Klan garb, which was meant to dishonestly portray Clinton and Byrd as Klan supporters. Byrd had severed ties with the Ku Klux Klan in 1952.[19]



in NBC dataset:

pepe gets a few references

centipde almost nothing

MAGA ubiquitous

"no brakes" almost nothing

cuck a few

"4D chess" almost nothing

SJW somewhat common

"God Emperor" almost nothing

Robert Byrd in KKK gets a few references


	...On June 12, 2016, the day of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, moderators of the /r/news subreddit began to remove many comments from its megathread pertaining to the shooting, leading to accusations of censorship.[21][22] Forbes reported that, in a "staggering" effect, /r/The_Donald was featured in 13 of the top 25 posts on /r/all that day, and that it gained over 16,000 subscribers during the weekend of the shooting. Forbes also reported that /r/news lost more than 85,000 subscribers.[22] Due to deliberate[23][24][25] manipulation by the forum's moderators and active users, the algorithm that dictated what content reached the /r/all page of Reddit resulted in a significant portion of the page being /r/The_Donald content. In response, Reddit administrators made changes to its algorithms on June 15, 2016, in an attempt to preserve the variety of /r/all.[13]


takes over r/all in wierd way after terrorist attack

also made the news

seem to be good at getting free publicity, I guess building up real users


	...The subreddit has hosted "Ask Me Anythings" (AMAs) of notable right-wing, conservative and alt-right figures supportive of Trump including Scott Adams, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, Helmut Norpoth, Curt Schilling, Peter Schweizer, Roger Stone, Milo Yiannopoulos,[28] Tucker Carlson,[29] and Corey Stewart.[30] Furthermore, Trump himself hosted an AMA on the subreddit on July 27, 2016,[31] which became one of /r/The_Donald's most upvoted posts.[32]


Coulter, Jones, Schwiezer, Stone probably witting Russian agents

who convinced Trump to do an AMA?


	...The subreddit was also noted for investigating Clinton's leaked emails after their release by WikiLeaks.[14][10] Their findings were subsequently reported by right-wing news media[36] while WikiLeaks acknowledged the subreddit in a tweet.[37]


interactions with propaganda sites?


	The subreddit also coordinated to vote on many online polls during the 2016 presidential debates.[4]

	The subreddit frequently attempted to manipulate Amazon.com's booklist via vote brigading, or encouraging subscribers to cast a certain review en masse. In November 2016, the subreddit was reportedly mobilizing readers to leave one-star reviews on Amazon.com for Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's autobiography, Settle for More, in response to what users considered biased reporting from her.[38] Amazon later removed many of the negative reviews.[39] Later, in September 2017, the subreddit attempted to buy copies of Trump's Great Again: How To Fix Our Crippled America to outsell Hillary Clinton's then-upcoming book What Happened. However, their plan backfired when several users bought other Trump books instead such as Trump: The Art of the Deal while Clinton's book reached #1 on the site.[40] The subreddit also spread a rumor that Clinton's book was actually the best-selling "contemporary women fiction" book.[41]


mobilized users to rig online polls, trash some amazon book reviews, get Trump's book to outsell clintons



https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-the-donald/
	Ideas have a way of originating on The_Donald or 4chan’s /pol/ board, then spreading to Facebook, and then somehow ending up on Fox News or even parroted by Trump himself. A Republican Capitol Hill staffer even crowdsourced ideas for anti-Clinton legislation from The_Donald. When Trump retweeted a GIF of himself symbolically beating up CNN at a professional wrestling match, the source was traced back to The_Donald.

	...Back in May, one member of The_Donald dumped the personal data of thousands of people who signed an anti-Trump petition on the subreddit’s Discord server, known as Centipede Central.

	...In addition to memes, The_Donald was also instrumental in digging up dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent in the 2016 election, and other Democrats. Anytime WikiLeaks published emails leaked from the Democratic National Committee or former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, The_Donald was there to sift through the emails and post what they found. This crowdsourced investigative tactic quickly led media outlets to pick up the damning stories.


developed some memes for Trump's tiwtter, doxxed some anti-Trump people's personal data, combed through wikileaks and fed to news sites

these are part of r/the_donald and /pol/s trolling culture

r/the_donald and /pol/ work well as a cover for these kinds of things

want to harass people and spread propaganda? astroturf a "community" with same ideas, blame it all on them.

It was the same idea in Soviet times--they taught spreading propaganda, ifiltrating capitalists, doing anything to make their ends as a part of "marxist theory." Make it part of an ideology, spread that ideology, and you'll always be able to mask your motives.

An example: IWW taught in writings that industrial sabotage would help the workers movement and "keep the soldier home." Now if an agent of yours gets caught blowing up some factories and you want to hide your involvement, you have some options. "Just another crazy wobbly..."

And they can get others to follow along with it too, even if not in any conspiracy--all the better for cover, and a source of recruits, too.

This is a classic idea for them I think, going back to Beletskii's "social experiments." A few agents leading a hoard of useful idiots, like the Okhrana agents bringing the Bolsheviks to power. It's crowd control--a necessary skill for an organization that wants to control revolutionary organizations to protect an authoritarian regime.



	...No other subreddit is the subject of more fascination or has stirred more hatred and outrage, both inside and outside Reddit, than The_Donald. Members of r/TheoryofReddit have posed the question of what makes The_Donald so popular so frequently that the topic is permanently banned from the discussion.


I have a theory :D


	Reddit user The_Blazer argued on a r/TheoryofReddit thread that The_Donald was ruining Reddit and that the paranoia of “fake news” and downvoting of dissenting opinions was spreading to the rest of Reddit. Before The_Donald, Reddit was a variety of opinions and little prejudice.

	“It was not like this before the election,” The_Blazer wrote.

	Few things were.


one way it had an impact

https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/53d5xb/what-is-rthedonald-donald-trump-subreddit
	Nailing down who the community's 172,000 subscribers are is a difficult, perhaps impossible endeavor that's nonetheless both fascinating and worth exploring as we consider how a relatively small community has become one of Reddit's most controversial, least understood, and most disruptive groups. Are they trolls? Are they GamerGate spinoffs? 4chan posters looking for a new outlet? Racists and xenophobes? Members of the #AllLivesMatter movement? Free speech obsessives? Could they impossibly all just be true Donald Trump believers?

	"A lot of people are genuinely pissed off economically and socially, but you have people who are engaging in this for different reasons, and then there's the people who are misguided and just racist. The problem with pseudonymous and anonymous internet communities is that it's hard to parse when someone is genuinely feeling these things and who is mining a weird moment in American history to get some laughs on the internet," Whitney Phillips, a Mercer University professor and researcher who spent four years embedded in 4chan as part of her doctoral thesis and eventual book about the trolling subculture, told me.

	"It's kind of like trying to talk about the whole of the American public in the singular, but it's even harder, because you have layers of anonymity and people who are just trying to provoke," she continued. "It's fascinating stuff, but it does not limit itself to tidy analyses or conclusions about what it all means."

https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-the-donald/
	One of the starkest examples of The_Donald’s blatant bigotry arrived in the aftermath of the Oct. 2, 2017, mass shooting in Las Vegas. Immediately after news of the massacre—the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history—commenters on The_Donald began calling for widespread aggression against Muslims based on pure speculation that the shooter was an Islamic terrorist. Once news broke that the shooter was instead a 64-year-old white man, The_Donald members quickly shifted their tone, calling into question media reports about the shooting and spreading the conspiracy theory that the attack was a “false flag” operation meant to further a left-wing, anti-gun agenda.

	There are dozens of autistic people on both 4Chan and Reddit who believe Julian Assange is dead. They’ve gone through extraordinary lengths to prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that both John ‘do you want to have pizza for an hour’ Podesta is a pedophile and Julian Assange is either dead and/or being tortured in a CIA black site.

was it mostly a social media thing?


	..And then there’s  this, an anonymous post, claiming to be part of Wikileaks under a gag order — claiming Wikileaks has been compromised and no longer under the command of Assange.


	...If Wikileaks was compromised, could you imagine the blackmail that could be levied from it, using their brand of transparency and truthfulness to degrade and rot those in the path of nefarious globalist scum?

	They are using the Trump victory and the MSM failure to distract us from the wikileaks situation and the boatloads of evidence on the undercover pedo ring and phase 3 of the Clinton emails, and the COMPROMISED dead man switch. Phase 3 not happening and no password release for insurance files is proof enough that Assange is captured or dead and that the dead man switch has failed. Why aren't we talking about this why aren't we investigating more into this my fellow centipedes! This is making me sick! We owe a lot to Assange and the Wikileaks infrastructure that helped us bring not only truth but evidence of the truth of our corrupt leaders and politicians. He certainly doesn't need to be thrown to the curb and forgotten like a used up expendable asset. We should be attacking this in full force here at The_Donald! We have to find the truth! We owe it to everyone who payed a price, some the ultimate price to deliver us the Truth. HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH! Do you people remember or is he forgotten too? You all should! Don't let his death and Julian's disappearance and possible death or capture be in vein, don't let their sacrifices and the sacrifices of others like them go in vein. We owe it to them and ourselves to continue their example of truth no matter the cost. Do what is right, spread and start as much discussion on this as we can we have to prove The_Donald stands by allies of truth and that we will not becomes the most famous Trump Presidency fan club. We have to continue the fight we won the battle but this war is far from over. If #MEMEMAGIC really does exist then let's use it to figure this out! WE CANT STOP UNTIL THOSE INSURANCE FILES ARE ABLE TO BE ACCESSED! #WhereisAssange #Justice4Assange r/whereisassange

	True, but I'm looking at the big numbers.

	I wonder how this will travel in the US Muslim community? Pretty sure they're big against this shit, too

	...[–]Kajensangel72KEK 81 points 1 year ago 

	They are so against this sort of thing. I have Muslim friends climbing the walls. As a Christian I'm also feeling pretty distressed. My family's take is that even if this was in some way can be minimised it's enough for us that they were even using the term so casually. You do not mess with the occult.

	My worry is that a lot of people will dismiss this as bullshit conspiracy stuff.


maybe worrying about wrong things...

	This is snowballing, townhall did a fairly tame piece on it and it came with this gem of an editors note.

	"This post has been updated with additional information for clarifying purposes. The "cookbook" is recipes of thoughts, not traditional food recipes. The author deeply regrets ever diving into this topic."

	The comments are also telling.

	Need to focus on the occult vs Satanist. Her "art" is occult art and is undeniably so... Occult needs to be the word of choice so she can't wiggle around.

	My cucked relatives are crying and praying. This subject just uncucked my extended family.

	I thought this whole "spirit dinner" thing was stupid and preposterous.

	They are religious, Cuban. OMFG. They all freaked the fuck out.


a lot of posts about how to use it to flip Clinton voters

maybe wanted to recruit readers to do the same?

	Lifelong democrat and so is my family. I know they won't support my decision but I can't sleep at night knowing that Killary is spirit cooking. The god emperor is smiling down upon us and he will defeat those in power that don't deserve to be there. You guys have helped me out so much opening my eyes on all the corruption that is going on. I feel like I have been asleep for 23 years. NOW I AM AWAKE LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN


why they uncover selected Russian bots on twitter but not reddit...

	The Ancient Centipede here. I've been apart of this subreddit from its mere beginnings and I want to tell everyone centipede here: PREPARE BATTLESTATIONS FOR THE NEXT 3 DAYS.

	Centipedes,

	The upcoming days will be extremely important. This is the culmination of all our hard work. We have shitposted, memed and dedicated our way to helping Trump.
	NOW IS THE TIME TO BE MOST VIGILANT.


	...Keep sharing the truth!

    Tell all of your friends about the Spirit Cooking. Tell them about the corruption. The email leaks. The questions being talked about before the debates. Talk to them about EVERYTHING. Use The Stump Cheat Sheet (v 2.0) (credit to u/Medically). Utilize it to prove your Hillary supporting friends wrong. Use it to combat CTR. It will be your greatest friend.

	Go to all of your friends and keep sharing the truth. Bring as many friends as you can to the polls.

	Stay on track.

	    There WILL BE people trying to take us off track. They I'll try to distract us with low energy posts. IGNORE THEM. They are only trying to separate us. Our goal is to get Trump into the White House.

	TRUST THE MODERATORS

	    A lot of you have been questioning what the mods are doing. Don't. They know exactly what they are doing. They are the mods for the most popular and controversial subreddit on Reddit. They not only have to deal with CTR, trolls and the mainstream media, but they have to also deal with Reddit admins and cucked subreddits.



	...KEEP UP THE HIGH ENERGY!!!

    THIS IS IT. The accumulation of all of our hard work. Many of us have shitposted our way into history. Exposed lies and corruption. We've lost hours of sleep looking through leaks BUT IT ISN'T OVER. Now is the time to reach MAXIMUM HIGH ENERGY. Do NOT let up! Keep shitposting your Pete's and your meme's. Keep exposing the Clinton's and their corruption. DON'T STOP NOW.

	...To u/OhSnapYouGotServed, you have done an outstanding job.
	KEEP UP THE WORK CENTIPEDES.
	LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN


pep talk for the team?


and why not? they are going to act like they're organized anyway, might as well put it out in the open. Say it's some "dedicated Trump fans" and some internet followers.

	Trump gave Putin info that helped prevent terror attack in Russia


do they actually believe this?

I guess most of them would be happier if they thought Trump was good for Russia, and not just bad for America

problem is that it turns out its bad for everybody

and they are a key conduit for blaming Russia
