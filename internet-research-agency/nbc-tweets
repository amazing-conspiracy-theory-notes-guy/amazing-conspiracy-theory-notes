I guess around here started pattern of painting Trump as underdog champion to right and racist rich evil-person to left

same narratives seen in MSM

to take a guess: disrupting U.S. politics was goal all along in their minds, and they saw Trump as the way to do it


did they get #TrumpBecause trending?

https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_get_twitter_historical_data

apparently costs money to get historical data

twitter has API for it for 1% of tweets


another long string of #TrumpBecause posts on 8/13

did they intend to use Trump and the concept of "Trump supporters" to divide the U.S.? paint Trump as racist, then impugn that disposition on everyone who voted for him

why promoting this story?


http://abcnews.go.com/US/muslim-woman-faced-discrimination-flight-united-airlines-calls/story?id=31442268
	After a Muslim woman accused the crew of a United Airlines flight of discrimination, the company has apologized for what it called a "misunderstanding."

	The passenger said a United attendant on the flight from Chicago to Washington on Friday refused to give her an unopened can of coke, allegedly telling her it could be used "as a weapon."

	"The flight attendant brought over an open can of diet soda, so I requested, for hygienic reasons, a closed can of diet soda," Tahera Ahmad, a chaplain at Northwestern University, told ABC's Chicago station WLS on Sunday. "And so she said, 'Well, no one has consumed from this can.' And I said, 'That's fine but I would really prefer for hygienic reasons and health concerns.' ... She said, 'Well, it is against our policy to give people unopened canned beverages.'"

	"And then she said, 'No diet coke for you,' and she picked up the beverage from my tray table and took it back," she said. 


i can see why

plays to narrative that Muslims calling out discrimination are just whiners, exploiting "political correctness" or something like that


	...Ahmad said she then asked the other passengers, "Did you all just witness this discrimination?" and she claims another passenger muttered "you Muslim" and told her to shut up.

	"And he said, 'You know you would use it as a weapon,'" Ahmad recounted.

	"I just couldn't believe what he had said," Ahmad said. "I was in tears." 


although in this telling actually faced discrimination...


	...The attendant apologized after the flight, Ahmad said, but she told the attendant that her actions made her feel "very threatened."

	"I was the one who felt very unsafe," Ahmad said.


still comes on a little too strong... just get an opened can of coke

can see why they'd want to promote her

"liberal tears" was a meme in their propaganda at one point, thought point was to get U.S. conservatives to like "trolling" liberals, empathize with them less. Maybe doing same with "Muslim tears?"

"liberal tears" probably only worked in conjunction with narrative that liberals control government, media. It's harder to get people to have that kind of disposition against a group of people unless they believe that group of people is powerful, in control, operssing them, that kind of thing

another theme is basically "Islam hates women." Came up in MSM too, started a debate among left about whether or not Islam compatible with leftist principles.

I guess part of point is to get even more people than conservatives to have negative disposition against Muslims. Calling attention to that debate and getting more people talking about it would probably also piss off and alienate Muslims some more.

most of the time way they paint Muslims is dehumaizing

written with underlying assumption their some kind of barbarian horde, not people


sum of their efforts looks like its to divide Muslims and non-Muslims living in U.S. The tweets in aggregate would create negative dispositions in these groups against each other.

Might have had in mind increasing recuirtment for ISIS, other radical groups

I guess they wanted to exploit this: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oscars-so-white

a lot of tweets purporting to take offense at that hashtag on 2/29/2016 (get it trending?)

painted as attack on whites, I guess wanted people to 'counter" with #OscarHasNoColor

I guess this is a way to start a fight around this too: some whites will feel offended by #OscarsSoWhite, other people will notice that "#OscarHasNoColor" is false and get annoyed, probably along partisan or racial lines

some of the "#OscarHasNoColor" "counter" tweets were openly racist, I guess paint the hash tag as racist and make a fight around it more bitter.

Similar to "#BlackLivesMatter" vs. "#AllLivesMatter" fight

"The #OscarsSoWhite hashtag is absolutely ridiculous. An #OscarSoBlack hashtag would cause riots in the streets #OscarHasNoColor"

sums up a lot of what they do--get whites to believe racial minorities are privileged instead

a lot of the tweets during election go toward saying Trump isn't racist and creating impression he has latino/a support. Maybe Trump's statements too racist even for KGB standards? they'd want to use him to divide the country, but at the same time want to at least create impression he could win.


...


what do they get out of this if it takes hold in public opinion?

Arpaio's operation (https://pastebin.com/n0KDeKBn) one: if people dehumanize illegal immigrants, turn blind eye toward racism, his "posse" can get away with what they did.

if members of the conspiracy hate illegal immigrants as Russian propaganda instructs, it would be easier to get them to do what they did, and easier to recruit.

some of apraio's posse ended up helping drug smuggling operations into the U.S., supposedly a strategic goal of the KGB (https://pastebin.com/EdM0xxzb)


racist cops shaking down illegal immigrants in the U.S. might have greater value as a prop for propaganda

http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2013/Sinaloa-Cartel/
	Why Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel Loves Selling Drugs in Chicago

	...As for rail transport, Chicago welcomes six of the seven major railroads and accounts for a quarter of the country’s rail traffic. Water? The Port of Chicago is one of the nation’s largest inland cargo ports, and the city is the world’s third-largest handler of shipping containers (after Singapore and Hong Kong). And let’s not forget about Midway and O’Hare: More than 86 million passengers and 1.5 million tons of cargo passed through these airports combined in 2011, the latest year for which data are available.

	Second, the Chicago metro area has a large Hispanic immigrant population, making it easy for Mexican cartel operatives to blend in. (Only Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston have more residents of Mexican descent, according to the 2010 census.)

	Because many of these immigrants—especially those who are here illegally—are poor or underemployed, the area provides a fertile recruiting ground for cartel operatives.

	...Finally, Chicago’s deeply entrenched street gangs offer a ready-made retail network. Law enforcement officials estimate the number of street gangs in the city at more than 70 and the number of members at between 70,000 and 125,000. The DEA’s Jack Riley likens them to “100,000 Amway salesmen” for cartel-supplied drugs.

	...As one senior member of the Latin Kings puts it: “This is far more complicated than a bunch of Mexicans getting together and bringing drugs into Chicago.” He calls the link between the Flores brothers and the streets the “gray area” of the drug trade.

	It appears that no one involved in the Flores brothers’ huge narcotics ring had strong ties, if any at all, to Chicago gangs. The twins employed old friends from the neighborhood, not gang members. Antonio Aguilera, for one, was a boyhood friend of the twins’ older brother. Jorge Llamas rescued Margarito Flores from a beating when they were teenagers. Other crew members were brought in by friends or friends of friends.

	Violence is bad for business; it scares away customers. A 2000 study by University of Chicago economics professor Steven Levitt and Columbia University sociology professor Sudhir Venkatesh found that the availability of drugs and their prices fell by 20 to 30 percent during gang conflicts. Which is why the drug trade has actually unified rival gangs, or at least pushed some into an imperfect détente, says Brian Sexton, head of the narcotics unit at the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. “They’ve realized that . . . if I can sell you dope, and you can sell it, and I can keep selling you dope, and I’m making money, what do I care about Folks or Peoples?”

	...The couriers who later testified said that the twins forbade them to carry guns. Few couriers had prior convictions. Nicholas Roti, the chief of the Chicago Police Department’s Bureau of Organized Crime, says that the cartel operatives try to stay “very low key.” He adds, “This is their retail outlet; they don’t want to mess this up.”

	Actually, most suspected smugglers arrested in Arizona and along the rest of the U.S.-Mexico border either are U.S. citizens or went through the yearslong process of becoming legal permanent residents.

	U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents — CBP statistics do not distinguish between the two — accounted for about two-thirds of smuggling arrests made by Tucson Sector Border Patrol agents in fiscal year 2015. Along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, citizens and legal residents accounted for 81 percent of smuggling arrests by agents.


cartels mostly recruit citizens and legal residenets

	They pick up undocumented immigrants at motel rooms or convenience-store parking lots north of the border. They wait at prearranged spots near the border or along highways for undocumented immigrants to hustle out of the brush and into their backseats or trunks.

	They then drive through Border Patrol checkpoints along Arizona highways on their way to stash houses in Tucson, Phoenix and small towns scattered throughout Southern Arizona, court records and statements made to federal judges at more than a dozen sentencing hearings show.


why do they do that?


	...Defense lawyer Jessica Turk is seeing more cases coming from Phoenix in which high school students are recruited through Facebook and told they can go to Tucson and make a few hundred bucks.

	In one case, a high school senior was arrested Sept. 8 after a Border Patrol agent pulled her over near Tombstone with an undocumented immigrant hiding under a cover in the back seat of her BMW.

	“Recruiters make it seem like a quick trip to Tucson,” Turk said.

	But when they get to Tucson, she said, they are told to go a little farther and they end up at the border.


	...Smuggling’s attraction often boils down to simply getting a paycheck.

	“It’s easy money, tax-free,” former Border Patrol chief Fisher said.


maybe cartel recruits mostly motivated by money, not getting back at racist conervatives

makes sense...

	...Defense lawyer Turk sees a deeper pattern among her clients, many of whom live in economically depressed areas of Arizona: women who were sexually abused as children and men whose fathers were absent due to being incarcerated, often on smuggling charges.


people poor, abent fathers, sexually abused, downtrodden

	“It’s like an equation,” Turk said. “You put in these factors and you get these results.”

	The lawyer for a woman who suffers from mental illness wrote in a memo to the court that her client’s life “reads like a Dickensian novel” and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her family was a “Petri dish for mental illness and despair.”

	"It was bullets that killed him, because he was shot in the face and the head," said his mother, Dionisia Villalobos. "But he had little pieces from the grenades all over his body."

	More than the violence, U.S. and Mexican officials and youth advocates said they fear that the rampant criminality is producing a generation that venerates cartel barons and views trafficking as a form of rebellion -- as well as an escape from poverty.

	"What struck me most in the short time that I was in Juarez was not the threat of violence," said Carlos Pascual, the new U.S. ambassador to Mexico. "It was the threat of what occurs if you lose a whole generation."

	To counter the lure of the cartels, the U.S. State Department last month organized a meeting of international youth groups in Mexico City to encourage the use of social networks to oppose violence. The co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, was mobbed by students asking for advice on how to build online communities to distribute positive messages and counter the cartels' propaganda.

	In Culiacan, a city in the western state of Sinaloa where many of Mexico's most notorious traffickers grew up, teenagers view the drug bosses as "heroes," said an 18-year-old woman who asked not to be identified. She said teenagers talk openly about the thrill of smuggling, work that can earn them about $500 a trip. 

	"Everyone around here talks about it, especially the kids," she said in an interview. "It's like -- I'm not sure how to describe it -- but they look at it like the ultimate wow." 


	... According to Mexican authorities, La Familia, a cartel based in the southwestern state of Michoacan, recruits members as young as 14. The organization inculcates the youngsters with a radical religious doctrine that demands loyalty, a promise to respect women and children -- and a commitment to kill rivals.

	The young gangsters emerge from a grim panorama marked by an absence of government authority. Calderón's wife, Margarita Zavala, said in October that 60 percent of Mexico's children live in poverty.

	"In some parts of this country, it would appear that the only options for children are to immigrate to the United States or become traffickers," said Teresa Almada, director of the Center for the Assistance and Promotion of Children in Juarez.

	In Juarez, where low-wage assembly plants called "maquiladoras" have been mothballed because of the recession, a third of all teenagers neither work nor attend school, according to census figures.

	"These days, youths are joining the drug cartels at an ever-younger age because they're cheap," said Martin Barron Cruz, a researcher at the National Institute of Criminal Science in Mexico. "It is a question of the market. A kid of 15 ends up doing the same job as a 20-year-old, but for half the money."

	"It is easier for the cartels to dispose of them when they are no longer needed," Barron said. "I say 'dispose' because, sadly, there's no other word for it. They eliminate them, often using another kid of the same age."

	Prisoners are also getting younger, Barron said. The largest cohort of inmates is now 19 to 25 years old.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Brotherhood
	The Aryan Brotherhood, also known as the Brand, or the AB, is a white supremacist and Neo-Nazi prison gang and organized crime syndicate in the United States with an estimated 15,000–20,000 members in and out of prison. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, although the Brotherhood makes up only a tiny percentage of the U.S. prison population, it is responsible for a highly disproportionate number of prison murders.

	The gang has focused on the economic activities typical of organized crime entities, particularly drug trafficking, extortion, inmate prostitution, and murder-for-hire.

	...In 1992, the Brotherhood established ties with American Mafia crime, via boss John Gotti, who was sentenced to prison and contacted the Brotherhood for protection while he was in prison. Gotti also organized a business partnership on the outside between his group and the Brotherhood on the outside, which greatly expanded the group's power on the streets.[34]

	Their communication and control has become so tight and efficient, that they have been able to organize and direct major criminal enterprises on the outside, even from solitary confinement, much to the frustration of federal and state authorities.[34]

	The group has an alliance[40] with La Eme (the Mexican Mafia) as the two are mutual enemies of Black Guerrilla Family.

racism as a way to get people into organized crime?

Aryan brotherhood thinks they have to "defend themselves" from gangs associated with other races

and presumably to raise money to "defend themselves," would have to sell a little meth on the side...

all for the cause, right?

	How immigration and ethnicity shaped delinquent youth groups (gangs) and adult organized crime syndicates (mobs) is examined. Ethnicity has played a key role in these organizations. Gangs and mobs used ethnic ties as an organizing principle to foster trust in their illicit activities. Scholars have usually applied the theory of ethnic succession to account for the changes in supremacy over the informal economy. Yet scholars have attached too much importance to the ethnic succession theory. To fully understand the underworld, scholars need to recognize interethnic cooperation, the persistence of class, and the rewards of whiteness.

	The pamphlet also lists several motives and techniques Russian and other Soviet operatives would use in their attempts to recruit someone: greed, blackmail, national pride, exploitation of emotions, “false flags”, ideology, naivete, and revenge


	...Appeals to national pride were typically “aimed at emigrants” from Eastern European and Soviet Bloc countries.

	...The “false flag” approach would see the target approached from someone claiming to be associated with an American ally or other group which the individual would want to help.

	...Ideological beliefs were also particularly exploited, though the focus had changed over the years. In the ’50s and ’60s, ideological approaches largely focused on those with “communist sympathies.” A more modern approach would be based on someone’s other views, such as a “desire for international harmony and world peace” or nuclear disarmament. Other ideological beliefs, such as a deep seated opposition to CIA or views on NATO, could similarly be used.

	...The final motive explored by the pamphlet was a desire for revenge, a self-explanatory and relatively easy to manipulate motive. It was, after all, “a quick way to wreak vengeance” while profiting off the bargain. “Needless to say, if an intelligence officer divines that a targeted American is dissatisfied … the spy will zero in on this discontent.”


the more reasons to hate the country you live in, the more ways to recruit!


	...The solution to all of this, however, remained simple - avoid these meetings to begin with, and if they occur report them immediately to a security officer or to the FBI. The worst thing that someone could do would be to try to handle it on their own. The Bureau warned that “any attempts by untrained or uninformed persons to handle hostile efforts on their own could result not only in personal disaster, but may also interfere with the FBI’s counterintelligence effort.” Nor was there any need for someone to go it alone - for anyone in the United States, “the FBI is as close as your nearest telephone.”

	The Hidden Agendas of Latino Activists
	Latino activist groups such as MEChA bring a racist agenda to the table of political power.

	...Reminisant of the anti-Vietnam demonstrations of the past, today carefully orchestrated protests and marches are taking place all over the United States. Crowds of expatriated Latinos (legal and illegal) and their supporters mug for the media carrying signs that insult the rule of law and the will of the American people. They carry foreign flags and sometimes burn the U.S. flag in protest. These organized marches are designed to make it appear to the gullible that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. support open borders and immigration amnesty. This is a lie.


something off with this article

	Who's pulling the strings on this big puppet show? Surprisingly, some of these puppeteers are from prominent mainstream organizations such as the National Council de La Raza that are funded by millions of taxpayer dollars and federal grants. The Spanish "La Raza" translates literally to "The Race." National Council de La Raza uses these funds to run charter schools and get-out-the-vote efforts to support their political agenda.  


"La Raza" used as a prop in Russian propaganda a lot--why? (maybe it's the name...)

maybe this article an example of propaganda targetting U.S. police



http://www.chicanxdeaztlan.org/
	MEChA de U of U has been saddened and angered by the recent political discourses and the surge of racist, anti-queer, sexist, xenophobic, islamophobic violence, both physical and emotional. We are truly inspired by the tenacity that our communities have demonstrated by continuing to fight back. We hope to celebrate and affirm our community’s resilience by sharing space, connecting, dialoguing, and collectively healing. We hope that the conference provides a space to think critically and explore issues of power, history, self-identity, and how we can decolonize the toxicity we have learned to normalize in order to take action and rebuild our communities.


I guess Trump and internet research agency propaganda would increase recuirting into these--but for what?


http://www.policemag.com/blog/gangs/story/2011/10/raza-racist-and-other-radicals.aspx
	...Cal State Northridge MEChA member Miguel Perez is quoted as saying, "The ultimate ideology is the liberation of Aztlan. Communism would be closest [to it]. Once Aztlan is established, ethnic cleansing would commence—non-Chicanos would have to be expelled—opposition groups would be quashed because you have to keep power."


maybe that? if "police magazine" can be trusted

I guess its easier to influence people if they join a secret society or some kind of club, whatever the society is.


http://www.chicanxdeaztlan.org/p/about-us.html
	What is Aztlán?
    
    Aztlán was the homeland of the Mexica (pronounced me-SHI- ka). Geographically it is the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. Today we understand Aztlán not as a defined territory. Instead, it is an idea that unifies all Raza as a sacred place of origin, to which Raza espouse a physical connection. Aztlán is the common homeland and is the place of the collective experience and social praxis.


that's kindof weird


another pan-[insert ethnicity here]-ism?

There has been no such “epidemic” on America’s university and college campuses, or anywhere else for that matter.)

RT Paul Jospeh Watson a lot, about 566 in dataset


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Joseph_Watson
	Political stance

	Watson, along with Jones and Infowars as a whole, used to discuss conspiracy theories such as chemtrails, the New World Order and the Illuminati before switching to material against feminism, Islam, and left-wing politics.[12] In an interview, Watson recalled, "I've talked about some quite fruity things in the past in my younger days, in terms of conspiracy theories. We don't all believe what we believed ten years ago."[15] Watson has been described as a member of "the new far-right" by The New York Times, who wrote in August 2017 that his "videos are straightforward nativist polemics, with a particular focus on Europe" and also noted his opposition to modernist architecture and modern art.[16] Iman A'tta, the director of the anti-Islamophobia group Tell MAMA, has said that "Paul Joseph Watson has become 'the' nexus for anti-Muslim accounts that we have mapped...He has become an influencer in promoting information—much of it bizarre and untrue—which has been regurgitated by anti-Muslim and anti-migrant accounts time and time again."[17]



Men's rights stuff shows up on r/The_Donald, but not as explicitly in this dataset:

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/search?q=men%27s+rights&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all


they use similar language in dataset to them--"red pill," "cuck," "alpha/beta male"

overlaps with alt-right by the time Trump came around I guess

	“Pepe is a cartoon frog who began his internet life as an innocent meme enjoyed by teenagers and pop stars alike,” the article reads.

	“But in recent months, Pepe’s been almost entirely co-opted by the white supremacists who call themselves the ‘alt-right,’ ” it continues. “They’ve decided to take back Pepe by adding swastikas and other symbols of anti-semitism and white supremacy.”

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Molyneux
	Stefan Basil Molyneux (/stəˈfæn ˈmɒlɪnjuː/; born September 24, 1966) is an Irish-born Canadian podcaster and YouTuber. Molyneux, a self-published author, usually speaks on topics including anarcho-capitalism, politics, race and intelligence, multiculturalism, right-libertarianism, anti-feminism,[2] and familial relationships.

	A supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, he has been described as alt-right by Politico and The Washington Post, and right-wing by CNN.[3][4][5][6] The Freedomain Radio internet community which he leads has sometimes been described as a cult.[7][8][9][6] 


wiki page sort-of whitewashes him

he does the "race and intelligence" thing, also anti-feminism and men's rights stuff



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cernovich
	Michael Cernovich (born November 17, 1977) is an American alt-right[6] social media personality, writer, and conspiracy theorist. His website "Danger & Play" started in 2012 and was originally known mainly for its content on men's empowerment. During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, it evolved into a largely pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton political blog.[7][8]

	Cernovich has denied being part of the alt-right movement[9] and has described himself instead as "new right"[10] and an "American nationalist".[11] He periodically promotes conspiracy theories,[7][12] such as Pizzagate, the debunked theory that high-ranking Democratic Party officials were involved in a child-sex ring.[11][13][14] Cernovich currently serves as a regular host of The Alex Jones Show on InfoWars, a right-wing radio show that often promotes conspiracy theories.[15]


	...In his early writings Cernovich focused on anti-feminism, men's empowerment, and how to meet women.[11] The title of Danger and Play came from a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche, "The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything." In 2014, Cernovich promoted Gamergate, the harassment campaign that targeted several women in the video game industry, goading opponents with tweets such as "Who cares about breast cancer and rape? Not me."[7]


a troll who gangs up on women

gamergate is interesting, seemed like a trial run for the sort of thing they're doing now

	...Cernovich frequently calls his adversaries "cucks", a variant of the alt-right slang word cuckservative, a pejorative term for conservatives who supposedly betray conservative social values. In reference to this he has written, "To beat a person, you lower his or her social status. Logic is pointless."[7] Cernovich admits to sometimes using trolling tactics, which he says he uses to build his brand rather than for his own amusement.[7]

	...Cernovich has accused the Democratic Party of attempting to assassinate him.[27][dubious – discuss] In 2016, Cernovich criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for speaking at a gender-segregated mosque.[28][29] In August 2012 Cernovich wrote that date rape "does not exist".[26] In October 2016 he wrote, "Lying about being in love to sleep with someone isn't rape. Getting played isn't rape. Regret isn't rape. Thinking, 'I might have been date raped,' means you weren't raped."[11]


if a "troll," why this in particular?



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Yiannopoulos
	Yiannopoulos is a former senior editor for Breitbart News, who describes himself as a "cultural libertarian".[4] He is a critic of feminism, Islam, social justice, political correctness, and other movements. Though often described as a member of the alt-right, he rejects this label, stating that there are many "points of difference" between him and the alt-right movement.[5] In October 2017, leaked emails revealed that Yiannopoulos had repeatedly solicited neo-Nazi and white supremacist figures on the alt-right for feedback and story ideas in his work for the website Breitbart. The leaked emails also showed that his book and many of his Breitbart articles were ghost-written


you could write a book about this guy

	
	...He was one of the first journalists to cover the Gamergate controversy. In 2015 he began work at Breitbart, attracting attention for his opinions and the company's association with the alt-right. 


gamergate and brietbart a meeting point for some of these people


	In the interview in a January 2016 episode of the podcast Drunken Peasants,[119] Yiannopoulos stated that sexual relationships between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women can "happen perfectly consensually", because some 13-year-olds are, in his view, sexually and emotionally mature enough to consent to sex with adults; he spoke favourably both of gay 13-year-old boys having sex with adult men and straight 13-year-old boys having sex with adult women.[120][121] He used his own experience as an example, saying he was mature enough to be capable of giving consent at a young age.[116] He also stated that "paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature" but rather that "paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty."[120][121]

	Later in the interview, after his previous comments received some pushback from the hosts, he stated: "I think the age of consent law is probably about right, that is probably roughly the right age ... but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them."[120]


maybe a victim himself... how did he get this way?


	...Leaked Breitbart emails

	In early October 2017, BuzzFeed News published leaked email chains from Yiannopoulos' tenure at Breitbart. According to the report, Yiannopoulos and his ghostwriter Allum Bokhari regularly solicited ideas for stories and comments from people associated with the alt-right and neo-Nazi movements.[6] Among the figures Yiannopoulos contacted were Curtis Yarvin, a central figure of the neoreactionary movement; Devin Saucier, the editor of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance; Andrew Auernheimer, the administrator of neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer; and Baked Alaska, a commentator known for his anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi tweets.[6]
