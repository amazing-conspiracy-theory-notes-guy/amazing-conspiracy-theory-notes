	WE SHALL END LIBERTY

	25. Far back in ancient times we were the first to cry among the masses of the people the words"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," words many times repeated since these days by stupid poll- parrots who, from all sides around, flew down upon these baits and with them carried away the well-being of the world, true freedom of the individual, formerly so well guarded against the pressure of the mob. 


also that French revolution ended up with things like new revolutionary 10 day calendar which sounds like a joke


doc says he was going to read out a list of traitors before he died

	On the Enemies of the Nation

	Speech given from the tribune of the Convention;
	7 Prairial, Year II (May 26, 1794);
	Translated: for marxists.org by Mitch Abidor;

	Citizens:

	It would be a beautiful subject for conversation for posterity; it’s already a spectacle worthy of heaven and Earth to see the Assembly of the people’s representatives placed upon the inexhaustible volcano of conspiracies bring to the feet of the Eternal Author of all things the homage of a great people with one hand, and, with the other, with the lives and the wrath of tyrants gathered against it, found the first republic in the world and recall exiled freedom, justice and nature among mortals.

	They will perish, all of the tyrants armed against the French people! They will perish, all the factions that rely upon their power in order to destroy our freedom. You will not make peace, but you will give it to the world, taking it from the hands of crime.

	This approaching prospect offered itself to the sight of the frightened tyrants, and they decided with their accomplices that the time had come to assassinate us; we, that is, the National Convention, for if they attack you now en masse and now individually you still recognize the same plan and the same enemies. Without a doubt they are not foolish enough to believe that the death of a few representatives can assure their triumph.

	If they believed, in fact, that in order to destroy your energy, or to change your principles, it was enough to assassinate those to whom you have especially confided the care of overseeing the salvation of the republic; if they believed that in throwing us into the tomb the spirits of Brissot, Hebert and Danton would emerge triumphant to deliver you a second time to discord, to the empire of factions and to the mercy of traitors, they were wrong.

	When we will have fallen under their blows, you would either complete your sublime enterprise or share our fate. Or rather, there is not one Frenchmen who would not want to stand over our bloody corpses to swear to exterminate the last of the enemies of the people.

	Nevertheless, their impious delirium attests both to their hope and their despair.

	They once hoped to succeed in starving the French people; the French people still lives and will survive all its enemies. Subsistence was assured, and nature, faithful to Liberty, already presents it abundance. What resource then remains to them? Assassination.

	They hoped to exterminate the national representation by bribed revolt, and they so counted on the success of this attack that they didn’t blush to announce it in advance to the wrath of Europe and to confess it in the English parliament. This project failed. What remains to them? Assassination.

	They thought they could overwhelm us by the efforts of their sacrilegious league, and especially by treason. The traitors tremble or perish, their artillery falls into our power, their satellites flee before us, but assassination remains to them.

	They sought to dissolve the National Convention by degradation and corruption. The Convention punished their accomplices and rose triumphant on the ruins of factions and under the aegis of the French people. But assassination remains to them.

	They attempted to deprave public morality and to extinguish the generous sentiments of which the love of freedom and of the fatherland are composed by banishing from the republic good sense, virtue and divinity. We proclaimed the divinity and the immortality of the soul; we commanded virtue in the name of the republic. Assassination remains to them.

	Finally, slander, treason, arson, poisoning, atheism, corruption, famine, assassinations. They were lavish with these crimes: assassination and yet more assassination still remain to them.

	Let us then rejoice and give thanks to heaven since we have so well served our country as to have been judged worthy of the daggers of tyranny.

	We thus have glorious dangers to run! The city offers as many such dangers as the battlefield. We have nothing to envy our brave brothers in arms; we pay, in more than one way, our debt to the fatherland.

	Oh kings and valets of kings! It is not we who will complain of the kind of war you make, and we recognize that it is worthy of your august prudence.

	In fact, it is easier to take our lives than to triumph over our principles and our armies. England, Italy, Germany, and France itself will furnish you soldiers to execute these noble exploits. When the powers of the earth league together to kill a feeble individual he must not insist on living; it is thus that living a long time doesn’t enter into our calculations. It’s not in order to live that we declare war on all tyrants and, what is even more dangerous, on all crimes.

	What man on earth has ever defended the rights of humanity with impunity?

	A few months ago I said to my colleagues on the Committee of Public Safety: “If the armies of the Republic are victorious, if we unmask the traitors, if we put down factions, they will assassinate us.” And I was not in the least astonished to see my prophecy realized. I myself find that the situation in which the enemies of the republic have placed me is not without its advantages, for the more uncertain and precarious are the lives of the defenders of the fatherland, the more independent they are of men’s evil.

	Surrounded by assassins I have already put myself in the new order of things where they want to send me. I only hold to fleeting life by the love of the fatherland and the thirst for justice and, separated more than ever from any personal considerations, I find myself better disposed to attack with energy the villains who conspire against us and humankind.

	The more they hurry to terminate my career down here, the more I hasten to fulfill those actions useful to the happiness of my like.

	At least I will leave a testament whose reading will make tyrants and their accomplices tremble. I will perhaps reveal redoubtable secrets that a pusillanimous prudence would have pushed me to hide.

	I will tell what the salvation of my fatherland and the triumph of freedom depend upon. If the same perfidious ones who guide the rage of the assassins aren’t yet visible to all eyes, I will leave to time the task of lifting the veil that covers them, and I will restrict myself to recalling those truths that alone can save this Republic.

	Yes, no matter what lack of seriousness with its lack of foresight might think, whatever perfidious counter-revolutionaries might say! The destiny of the republic is not yet fixed, and the vigilance of the people’s representatives is more than ever necessary.

	It is not the pomp of denominations, not victory, nor riches nor fleeting enthusiasm that constitute the republic; it is the wisdom of laws and especially the goodness of mores; it is the purity and the stability of the maxims of government.

	The laws are to be made, the maxims of government to be assured, and the mores to be regenerated. If one of these things is missing there is in a state naught but errors, pride, passions, factions, ambitions and cupidity. Far from repressing vices the republic would then only allow them freer expansion, and vice necessarily returns us to tyranny.

	Whoever is not master of himself is made to be the slave of others. This a truth that applies to peoples as well as individuals. Do you want to know who are the ambitious?

	Examine who they are who protect the rogues who encourage counter-revolutionaries, who execute attacks, who hold virtue in contempt, who corrupt public morals: it was the march of the conspirators who fell under the mailed fist of the law.

	To make war on crime is the path to the tomb and to immortality; to favor crime is the path to the throne and the scaffold.

	Perverse beings managed to throw the Republic and human reason into chaos. It’s a matter now of pulling them from this in order to create the harmony of the moral and political worlds. The French people have two guarantors of the possibility of executing this heroic enterprise: the current principles of representation and its own virtues.

	The moment in which we find ourselves is favorable, but it is perhaps unique. In the state of equilibrium in which things are it is easy to consolidate liberty, and it is easy to lose it. If France were to be governed for a few months by a corrupted legislature, freedom would be lost. Victory would fall to the factions and immorality.

	Your concert and you energy have astonished and defeated Europe. If you come to know this as well as your enemies you will easily triumph. I spoke of the virtue of the people. Attested to by the entire revolution, this virtue would not alone suffice to reassure us against the factions who attempt without cease to corrupt and tear apart the republic.

	What is the reason for this? It’s that there are two peoples in France.

	The one is the mass of citizens, pure, simple thirsting for justice and friends of liberty. It is this virtuous people that spills all its blood to found the republic that is imposing to internal enemies and shakes the thrones of tyrants.

	The other is a mass of the ambitious and intriguers, it’s the chatting, charlatan, artificial people who show themselves everywhere, who persecute patriotism, who grab onto the tribunes and often the public functions; who abuse the learning that the advantages of the ancien regime gave them in order to fool public opinion. It’s this people of rogues, of foreigners, of hypocritical counter-revolutionaries who place themselves between the people and their representatives in order to fool the one and slander the other; to block their operations, to turn against the public good the most useful laws and the most salutary truths.

	As long as this impure race exists the Republic will be unhappy and precarious. It’s up to you to deliver it by an imposing energy and an unalterable concert.

	Those who seek to divide us, those who stop the march of the government, those who slander it every day among you by perfidious insinuations, those who seek to form against it a dangerous coalition of all the evil passions, of irascible pride, of all the interests opposed to the public interest are your enemies and those of the fatherland. They are foreign agents.

	They are the successors of Brissot, of Hebert, of Danton. If they were to reign one day the Fatherland would be lost.

	In saying these things I sharpen daggers against myself, and it is precisely for this that I say them.

	You will persevere in your principles and in your triumphal march. You will put down crime and you will save the fatherland...

	I have lived long enough... I saw the French people rise up from degradation and servitude to the heights of Glory and Freedom. I saw the chains broken and the guilty thrones that weigh upon the earth near to being overthrown by triumphant hands.

	I saw a yet more astonishing marvel, a marvel that monarchical corruption and the experience of the first period of our Revolution barely allowed to be seen as possible: an assembly invested with the strength of the French nation, marching with a rapid and firm step towards public happiness, devoted to the cause of the people and to the triumph of equality, worthy of giving to the world the signal of Liberty and the example of all the virtues.

	Accomplish, Citizens, accomplish your sublime destiny. You have placed us in the vanguard to bear up under the first efforts of the enemies of Liberty; we will be worthy of this honor, and with our blood we will trace the route of immortality.

	May you constantly deploy that unquenchable energy which you need to put down the monsters of the universe that conspire against you, and to then enjoy in peace the benedictions of the people and of the fruits of your virtues.

how was Robespierre shot?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pXxoyk5wOo&t=1h25m0s	
	Robespierre and his associates are taken to City Hall, where they remain under watch for the night.

	Shots ring out in the early morning. Guards race to the second floor. They fling the doors open to a grisly scene. One of Robespierre's allies has thrown himself from the window. Another has taken a pistol to his head. And Robespierre is found semi-conscious with a bullet-wound to the face, has jaw shattered from an apparent suicide attempt.

	Robespierre spends his last hours on the table of the Committee of Public Safety, the very room where he had piloted the terror to its hideously bloody peak. As he is ridiculed and insulted by his former colleagues, Robespierre is unable to respond. The grand master of oratory has been silenced.



https://books.google.com/books?id=kYLu7-cPJTYC&pg=PA218
	None of Robespierre's allies was able to make the Convention listen, and it proceeded to order the arrest of Hanriot, Dumas and other Robespierrist officials, then five deputies: the two Robespierres, St-Just, Couthon and Lebas. The deputies were taken before the Committee of General Security, then sent to different prisons. Maximilien was taken to the Luxembourg Prison, where the startled officers refused to process him, then to the mayor's office where again he was greeted by senior police administrators. No one wanted to arrest the deputies or officials. Who would want to take responsibility for interning 'the Incorruptible'? Finally the deputies found their way to the Town Hall. Hanriot, the mayer Lescot-Fleuriot and Payan summoned a special meeting of the Commune, mobilized the National Guard and closed the city gates.

	Lescot-Fleuriot called on the people of Paris to save those 'who have made the Republic's armies triumph' against the new conspirators in the National Convention. But most of the forty-eight sections made no move: only thirteen finally sent batallions to defend the Town Hall against the Convention. Even so, they had considerable force at their disposal, but were immobilized by uncertainty as to whether to march on the Convention. The Convention had declared itself in permanent session and, after a brief adjournment, resumed again at seven in the evening. News arrived that Robespierre and his allies had called on armed support from the sections. The Convention declared the five deputies outlaws. It gathered sufficient armed forces and, headed by Leonard Bourdon, they entered the Town Hall at about half past two in the morning. By then the sections had melted away from the Place de Greve, in front of the Town Hall, and the armed forces were able to make the arrests, including of Augustin, who broke both legs after leaping from a window in an attempt to escape.

	When the Convention's forces entered, Robespierre was signing a desparate appeal to his own neighbourhood section:

		Commune of Paris, Executive Committee.
		9th Thermidor.

		Courage, partiots of the Section de Piques! Liberty is triumphant! Already those whose firmness is feared by the traitors are at liberty. Everywhere the People is showing itself worthy of its character. The rendezvous is at the Town Hall, where the brave Hanriot will carry out the orders of the Executive Committee that has been formed to save the country.

		Louvet, Payan, Lerebous, Legrand, Ro-

	He would not know that his section, a model of careful deliberation and surveillance, had already rebuffed the Commune's request: 'as long as no order has been received from the National Convention, no order will be given to provide armed force.' By the next day it was describing him as a 'scoundrel'.

	Robespierre's unfinished signature may have been the result of uncertainty about declaring the Commune to be in a state of insurrection against the National Convention. For was not the Convention the French people itself? The incomplete signature is surrounded by spatters of blood. Lebas had two pistols: some have suggested that he blew his brains out with one and that Robespierre tried to commit suicide with the other. Others prefer to believe that he was shot by a gendarme as he was signing the document: he would never have despaired enough to commit suicide when there was still so much to do.

	It was a drawn-out and exruciating agony. The bullet had smashed Robespierre's jaw at 2.30 a.m. At 3.30 he was placed in the waiting room of the Committee of Public Safety, where the curious were able to observe his pain. Two health officers were sent by the Committee of General Security to the Tuileries at 5 a.m., where they found him lying on a table, 'covered with blood'. They inspected the wound to his left cheek, which had smashed his teeth and jaw, and applied bandages to soak up the blood in his mouth, during which 'the monster did not take his eyes off us, but without uttering a word.' ...The curious had already started congregating: 'several of them who were closest lift his right arm to see his face; one says, "He's not dead, because he's still warm, another says, "Isn't he a fine-looking king?" Another says, "even if it were Ceasar's body, why wasn't it thrown on the garbage dump?"

	Robespierre and the others were transferred to the Conciergerie at 11.00 a.m. and condemned to death. He was unable to do anything other than moan, and repeated gestures he made for a pen and paper were refused.


http://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/account-arrest-of-robespierre-1794/
	This excerpt from a pamphlet published in Paris in August 1794 recounts the arrest of Robespierre and the nature of his injuries:

	“They went into the Hotel de Ville and found Robespierre in a room near the session chamber. He was lying on the ground, a pistol shot through his jaw. They picked him up, and some of the sans culottes carried him by his feet and his head; there were at least a dozen round him. They tore off his right sleeve and the back of his blue coat. Meanwhile a gendarme found Couthon and fired a pistol into his body. They searched for the rest of the conspirators.

    Robespierre was taken to the Committee of Public Safety, still carried by the same men in the same way. He hid his face with his right arm. The procession paused briefly at the foot of the main stairs. Inquisitive people joined the crowd; several of the nearest lifted his arm to look at his face. One said, ‘He isn’t dead, he’s still warm.’ Another said, ‘Isn’t that a fine king?’ Another: ‘And suppose it was Caesar’s body? Why hasn’t it been thrown on the rubbish dump?’

    The men carrying Robespierre did not want him touched and the ones at his feet told the others at his head to keep it well up, so as to save what little life he had left. They carried their load up at last to the main committee chamber and put it down on a large table opposite a window. They laid his head on a box full of mouldy ration bread. He did not move but he was breathing heavily, and put his right hand on his forehead. Clearly he was trying to hide his face (disfigured as he was, he still showed signs of vanity). Sometimes his forehead contracted and he frowned. Although Robespierre seemed half-conscious, his wounds were clearly causing him great pain.

    Among those who brought him in there were a gunner and a fireman, who never stopped talking to him. They made jokes constantly. One would say, ‘Sire, your majesty is in pain,’ and the other, ‘Well, I think you have lost your tongue, you haven’t finished your proposal, and it began so well. Ah, the truth is, you utterly deceived me, you scoundrel.’ Another citizen said, I only know of one man who understood the art of tyranny, and that is Robespierre.’

    Soon afterwards Elie Lacoste of the Committee of General Security arrived. They showed him the prisoners and he said ‘They must be taken to the Conciergerie, they are outlaws.’ They were removed. Next, he spoke to a surgeon and told him to ‘dress Robespierre’s wounds and make him fit for punishment’. The surgeon said that the lower jaw was broken. He put several wads of linen into his mouth to soak up the blood which filled it. Several times he passed a probe through the hole the ball had made, bringing it out through the mouth; then he washed his face and put a piece of lint on the wound. On this he placed a bandage which went round his chin; then he bandaged the upper part of his head.

    During this operation, everyone offered his comments. When they put the bandage round his head, a man said, ‘Now they are crowning his majesty’. He must have heard all this, for he still had some strength and often opened his eyes. When the wound was dressed they laid him down again, taking care to put the box under his head as a pillow until, they said, ‘it was time for him to put his head through the little window’ [of the guillotine].”
