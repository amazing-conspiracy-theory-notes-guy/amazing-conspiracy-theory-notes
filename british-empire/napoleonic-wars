	WE SHALL END LIBERTY

	25. Far back in ancient times we were the first to cry among the masses of the people the words"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," words many times repeated since these days by stupid poll- parrots who, from all sides around, flew down upon these baits and with them carried away the well-being of the world, true freedom of the individual, formerly so well guarded against the pressure of the mob. 

	...26. In all corners of the earth the words "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity," brought to our ranks, thanks to our blind agents, whole legions who bore our banners with enthusiasm.

	THE role of Britain in the world was transformed by the Napoleonic conflict. By the time France declared war in 1793 the British empire was in decline; it had lost its North American colonies a decade earlier. But after Napoleon’s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 Britain emerged as the world’s pre-eminent superpower. How did it overcome its previous setbacks to inflict a crushing defeat on Napoleon’s France? Historians have tended to explain this in terms of military and naval strategy. But “Britain against Napoleon”, a new book by Roger Knight of the University of Greenwich, argues that Britain was just far better at organising its war effort.

	Between 1803 and 1815, Great Britain was the most constant of Napoleon's enemies. Through its command of the sea, subsidies to allies on the European mainland, and active military intervention in the Peninsular War, Britain played the central role in Napoleon's downfall even as all the other major powers switched back and forth.

	The peninsular war proved disastrous to Napoleon. Subsequently, he said, that it was the "Spanish ulcer" which ruined him. Similarly, the Russian campaign of Napoleon destroyed his army.

	The role of Britain in bringing about the downfall needs to be emphasized.
	It was she who formed coalition to destroy the French revolution.

	 After Napoleon, a period of Reactionary governments swept Europe. Having swung so far one way during the French Revolution and Napoleon's rule, the historical pendulum now swung back the other way, as rulers tried to prevent the "excesses" of the French Revolution from happening again. Fear among the traditional rulers was not without basis, either. Revolution was brewing throughout Europe.
