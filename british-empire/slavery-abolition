	William Wilberforce, only son of Robert Wilberforce (1728–1768) and Elizabeth Bird (1730–1798), was born in Kingston upon Hull on 24th August 1759. His paternal grandfather, William Wilberforce (1690–1776), established the family fortunes through the Baltic trade and was twice mayor of Hull. (1)

	...Wilberforce was not an active member of the House of Commons and did not make his first speech until May 1781 when he argued that the proposed legislation, the Prevention of Smuggling Act, that "it would not only be severe, but unjust to confiscate the vessel" of a captain involved in these illegal trade. The second speech also reflected the interests of his electors when he requested government contracts for Hull. In fact he spent most of his time at the three most important gentlemen's clubs, White's, Boodle's and Brooks's, in London. (9) 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%27s
	White's is the oldest gentleman's club in London, founded in 1693, and is widely considered to be the most exclusive private club in the world.[1][2] Notable current members include Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Conrad Black and Tom Stacey. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron was formerly a member for fifteen years but resigned in 2008, despite his father Ian Cameron having previously been the club's chairman, over the club's declining to admit women.[3][4][5][6][7] White's continues to maintain its standards as an establishment exclusively for gentlemen; brief exceptions were made for the visits by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991[7] and 2016.

	...White's quickly made the transition from teashop to exclusive club and in the early 18th century, it was notorious as a gambling house; those who frequented it were known as "the gamesters of White's." The club gained a reputation for both its exclusivity and the often raffish behaviour of its members. Jonathan Swift referred to White's as the "bane of half the English nobility."[9]

	...Alvanley's was not the most eccentric bet in White's famous betting book. Some of those entries were on sports, but more often on political developments, especially during the chaotic years of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars.

	...The Club bar is more compact than that of other clubs. An amusing description of it and the rationale behind its size may be found in Chapter Ten of the spy novel The Sixth Column (1951) by Peter Fleming (brother of Ian Fleming)

	Elliott could not believe, until the evidence was compelling, that Philby, a member of the Athenaeum (adjoining the Travellers) was a Soviet spy. Sir Stewart Menzies, head of MI6 at the time and staunch defender of Philby when confronted by MI5's suspicions, was a member of White's club, and as Macintyre observes, "rode to hounds, mixed with royalty, never missed a day at Ascot, [and] drank a great deal ..."

	Where the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), Major-General Sir Stewart Menzies (pronounced 'Mingiss'), celebrated 'Victory in Europe' (VE) day is not known, but it is more than likely that he was standing at the bar of White's Club in St James's where too much of the informal business of intelligence work was still undertaken.

	A History of the British Secret Service

	A new type of amateur spy became evident in the middle of the eighteenth century, similar to the Elizabethean scholar who travelled widely and sent back intelligence reports to his country. But in the eighteenth century such matters were relatively worse organized than in the sixteenth century and the impetus for such matters came from the travellers themselves rather than from the Secret Service in London. The new amateur spy was the young aristocrat or scion of the upper middle classes who made the Grand Tour of Europe to complete his education. It was an age in which secret societies and clubs sprang up all over England. As the brothers Goncourt wrote in the same century, 'if two Englishmen were to be cast aside on an unihabited island, their first consideration would be the formation of a club'.

	...Many of these clubs took on a definite political hue, some were even bigotedly political in their choice of members, while there were a few devoted to subversive activities which attracted the attention of the Secret Service.

	...perhaps the most remarkable of all these clubs and certainly the one which enjoyed the greatest notoriety was that entitled the 'Knights of Saint Francis of Wycombe', often errenously reffered to as the 'Hell-Fire Club'.


https://books.google.com/books?id=j-bDYtcoG9IC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39
	An incident related by George Selwyn - the well-known wit and member of the infamous Hellfire Club - describes what Wilberforce was like when out on the town. One night in the early 1780s Selwyn was leaving the House of Commons when he passed a roomful of young men "who made me, from their life and spirit, wish for one night to be twenty. There was a table full of them drinking - young Pitt, Lord Euston, Barkley, North, etc. etc. staging and laughing... Some of them sang very good catches: one Wilberforce, a Member of Parliament sang the best."

	This club was founded by the squire of West Wycombe, Sir Francis Dashwood, a rake-hell and flamboyant character, who, for a brief period, was chancellor of the Exchequer. At one time some of the most influential of Cabinet Ministers were members of this strange club which used to meet first in Medmenham Abbey on the Thames and later in caves carved out of West Wycombe Hill underneath the church.

	...A shocked public learned that its political leaders had for years been masquerading in the semi-ruined Abbey of Medmenham. Not only had they dressed up as 'monks' and indulged in mysterious rites, but they had admitted to their strange society masked and hooded women whom they were pleased to call 'nuns'. When the secret of Medmenham became known, this rakes' club transferred its headquarters to caves cut deep into the heart of West Wycombe Hill.

	The Hell-fire Clubs: A History of Anti-morality

	The Hell-Fire Clubs conjure up images of aristocratic rakes outraging respectability at every turn, cutting a swath through the village maidens and celebrating Black Masses. While all this is true, it is not the whole story. The author of this volume has assembled an account of the Clubs and of their antecedents and descendants. At the centre of the book is the principal brotherhood, known by the Hell-Fire name - Sir Francis Dashwood's notorious Monks of Medmenham, with their strange rituals and initiation rites, library of erotica and nun companions recruited from the brothels of London.


https://www.amazon.com/History-British-Secret-Service-Standard/dp/0586051163/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0586051163&pd_rd_r=KJVV5AXD8YDTGEXBJH18&pd_rd_w=HvE4s&pd_rd_wg=4yHhn&psc=1&refRID=KJVV5AXD8YDTGEXBJH18
	...Most of the legends surrounding this club - that it's members practised black magic and celebrated black masses in Medmenham Abbey and in the caves - are quit erroneous and the result of malicious propaganda by political opponents of its leading members.


https://books.google.com/books?id=nOSGCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11
	The excess of the Hellfire Club led to a ressurrection of the Society for the Reformation of Manners in the 1750s. It had first started in the 1690s and had been active in the early years of George I in bringing prosecutions against the owners of brothels and molly houses (where homosexuals held their meetings). Later, its activities were subsumed in the Society for the Suppression of Vice set up by William Wilberforce in 1787.


https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638853?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents
	...The particular forms of vice which the founds of the society selected for suppression they eventually listed as follows: profanation of the Lord's Day and profane swearing; publication of blasphemous, licentious and obscene books and prints; selling by false weights and measures; keeping of disorderly public houses, brothers, and gaming houses; procuring; illegal lotteries; cruelty to animals. In their early years of activity members of the society had to face a considerable amount of hostility and ridicule.

	Yet existing accounts of the Vice Society's early activities remain vague, incomplete and sometimes contradictory, even on basic issues. Who, for example, founded the society? (Historians have commonly, though not unanimously, assumed the founders to be evangelicals acting under guidance, or at least inspiration, from William Wilberforce and the 'Clapham Sect'.)  More generally, what were the motives of the founders? Why did they choose to define vice in the way that they did?


https://www.amazon.com/History-British-Secret-Service-Standard/dp/0586051163/ref=pd_cp_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0586051163&pd_rd_r=KJVV5AXD8YDTGEXBJH18&pd_rd_w=HvE4s&pd_rd_wg=4yHhn&psc=1&refRID=KJVV5AXD8YDTGEXBJH18
	...But there is no doubt at all that it was infiltrated by secret agents, both British and foreign, because it made an admirable listening post. The British agents used it as a club where valuable intelligence could occasionally be obtained when the wine flowed freely and also to exploit the club for political ends.

	...It would be in keeping with his fondness for amorous adventure that he used his disguise to seduce the Czarina Anne, a liason which is said to have been maintained for some moths.

	...It was, however, the ability of Dashwood to make friends with the females at the Russian court which enabled him to set up what until then London had lacked, agents in St Petersburg who could supply intelligence. he wormed his way into the confidence of the Grand Duchess Catherine, thus paving the war for further consolidation of Anglo-Russian relations by Ambassador Sir Charles Hanbury-Williams. There are also indications that Dashwood was active as a British spy in italy, though Horace Mann, the head of British espionage in Rome, sent home reports complaining that Dashwood was 'a Jacobite agent'


https://world.pulse.rs/the-hellfire-club/
	...the best known branch of the club was founded by Sir Francis Dashwood, around 1749 in England. Later, there was close cooperation between the club of  Sir Francis Dashwood and famous Brook’s club, which was considered one of the most famous so-called gentleman clubs


https://books.google.com/books?id=T-8LbCrAng0C&pg=PT8&lpg=PT8
	Wilberforce was a man who was very gifted. He had a natural charm; he was very amusing; he was quick-witted; he had a good singing voice. But he devoted his early life to having a good time, to pleasure. He had a lot of fun. He had a good group of friends and they liked to play cards, to gamble, to wine and dine. He belonged to five London Clubs. He was a bit of a dillittante.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Dilettanti
	The group, initially led by Francis Dashwood, contained several dukes and was later joined by Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, Uvedale Price and Richard Payne Knight, among others. It was closely associated with Brooks's, one of London's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs.


https://books.google.com/books?id=T-8LbCrAng0C&pg=PT8&lpg=PT8
	Then at the age of twenty-one he entered politics. Some time later Pitt and Wilberforce (who were both the same age) were discussing the future of their careers at Brooks's club in London.


https://books.google.com/books?id=J6BnSZoSMAYC&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278
	Brooks's Club, founded in 1764, is the oldest of the surviving clubs in London, and one of the first to have permanent rooms; the current building dates from 1778. On my visit, somewhat to my surprise a very amicable attendant named Alistair showed me around the upstairs parlor. They had an original wooden gaming table from the club's earliest days, with a semicircle cut into it to accomodate the girth of Charles James Fox, an eager but obese card player. The walls were decorated with oil portraits of the first Dilettanti Society members in fancy dress. Today, the twelve members of the society still meet at Brooks's Club every three moths; the initiation rites, devised by Sir Francis Dashwood, are still secret, although it is known that they involve fancy dress.


https://books.google.com/books?id=4MdlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT23&lpg=PT23
	More important to his career was the exclusive clubs of St. James's. As a man of the mercantile class Wilberforce would never make his way in the Commons without full acceptance in the clubs. He told his sons of the first time he entered Broks's, a greenhorn from the province who knew scarcely anyone above the rank of private gentleman or baronet; how he stood uncomfortably watching the faro, a complicated form of betting on cards which was not a game of skill like whist or piquet, and starting gaming from shyness more than pleasure. An acquantance who had not heard of his election to the club came in and said he was glad to see him. 'Oh, don't interrupt him,' said old George Agustus Selwyn, the well-known wit, who was keeping the bank and thus stood to win the most. 'He is very well employed.' 'They considered me as a fine fat pigeon whom they might pluck,' chucked Wilberforce.

	It was a good story. But in fact he was not elected one of the three hundred members of Brooks's until 7 April 1783 when he was fully established as a popular young men about town, though it is possible he had not played faro. He was already a member of White's across the street, since 1781: later he became its chairman. His election to White's proved that he had overcome Society's contempt for fortunes founded in 'Trade' rather than the land, and the elderly Duke of Norfolk did not think it odd to lose £100 to the merchant's son.


https://books.google.com/books?id=T-8LbCrAng0C&pg=PT8&lpg=PT8
	Then something happened, over a period of months, when he was twenty-five. He describes it as 'The Great Change'. Basically, he fell in love with Jesus Christ. From that moment on, to use his own words, quoting the book of Hebrews, he 'fixed his eyes on Jesus' (Hebrews 12:2). His relationship with Jesus Christ became the number one priority in his life.


http://spartacus-educational.com/REwilberforce.htm
	...Wilberforce contemplated giving up politics for a life as a clergyman. John Newton, a former slave-trader, who had become a devout Christian, persuaded Wilberforce that he could serve God better by remaining in Parliament and campaigning for social reform. Wilberforce renounced all "things of the flesh". He resigned from all his gentlemen clubs and "exchanged his socializing and entertaining for one of reflection and re-evaluation".

	...The House of Commons agreed to establish a committee to look into the slave trade. Wilberforce said he did not intend to introduce new testimony as the case against the trade was already in the public record. Ellen Gibson Wilson, a leading historian on the slave trade has argued: "Everyone thought the hearing would be brief, perhaps one sitting. Instead, the slaving interests prolonged it so skilfully that when the House adjourned on 23 June, their witnesses were still testifying." (30)

	The Great Abolition Sham

	...It is a dramatic and suspenseful story, with opposition from expected and unexpected quarters and internal squabbling and falling-out. MP William Wilberforce brought in a Private Member's Bill for the abolition of the slave trade every year for eighteen years, but it was the movement on the ground that turned public opinion. 


http://spartacus-educational.com/REwilberforce.htm
	...On 18th April 1791 Wilberforce introduced a bill to abolish the slave trade. Wilberforce was supported by William Pitt, William Smith, Charles Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, William Grenville and Henry Brougham. The opposition was led by Lord John Russell and Colonel Banastre Tarleton, the MP for Liverpool. There was no reasoned justification of slavery or the slave-trade. Thomas Grosvenor, the MP for Chester, acknowledged that it was "not an amiable trade but neither was the trade of a butcher an amiable trade, and yet a mutton chop was, nevertheless, a good thing." One observer commented that it was "a war of the pigmies against the giants of the House". However, on 19th April, the motion was defeated by 163 to 88. (38) 

	...In March 1796, Wilberforce's proposal to abolish the slave trade was defeated in the House of Commons by only four votes. At least a dozen abolitionist MPs were out of town or at the new comic opera in London. Thomas Clarkson commented: "To have all our endeavours blasted by the vote of a single night is both vexatious and discouraging." Wilberforce wrote in his diary: "Enough at the Opera to have carried it. Very much vexed and incensed at our opponents". (41) 

	...William Wilberforce introduced an abolition bill on 30th May 1804. It passed all stages in the House of Commons and on 28th June it moved to the House of Lords. The Whig leader in the Lords, Lord Grenville, said as so many "friends of abolition had already gone home" the bill would be defeated and advised Wilberforce to leave the vote to the following year. Wilberforce agreed and later commented "that in the House of Lords a bill from the House of Commons is in a destitute and orphan state, unless it has some peer to adopt and take the conduct of it". (44) 

	In February 1805, Wilberforce presented his eleventh abolition bill to the House of Commons. Charles Brooke reported that the French slave trade was resurgent, so that abolition would merely hand British commerce over to the enemy. Wilberforce replied: "The opportunity now offered may never return, and if the present moment be neglected, events may occur which render the whole of the West India islands one general scene of devastation and horror. The storm is fast gathering; every instant it becomes blacker and blacker. Even now I know not whether it be too late to avert the impending evil, but of this I am quite sure - that we have no time to lose." This time the pro-slave trade MPs were better organised and it was defeated by seven votes. (45) 



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution
	The Haitian Revolution (French: Révolution haïtienne [ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ ajisjɛ̃n]) was a successful anti-slavery and anti-colonial insurrection by self-liberated slaves against French colonial rule in Saint-Domingue, now the sovereign nation of Haiti. It began on 22 August 1791 at 22:00,[3] and ended in 1804 with the former colony's independence.


http://spartacus-educational.com/REwilberforce.htm
	...This time there was little opposition and the bill was passed by an overwhelming 114 to 15. In the House of Lords Lord Greenville made a passionate speech that lasted three hours where he argued that the trade was "contrary to the principles of justice, humanity and sound policy" and criticised fellow members for "not having abolished the trade long ago". Ellen Gibson Wilson has pointed out: "Lord Grenville ... opposed a delaying inquiry but several last-ditch petitions came from West Indian, London and Liverpool shipping and planting spokesmen.... He was determined to succeed and his canvassing of support had been meticulous." When the vote was taken the bill was passed in the House of Lords by 41 votes to 20. (48)

	Wilberforce now spent his energies developing the Sierra Leone Company as a foundation for disseminating Christianity and civilization in Africa. It has been argued by Stephen Tomkins that during this period "Wilberforce... allowed the abolitionist colony of Sierra Leone... to use slave labour and buy and sell slaves.... After abolition, the British navy patrolled the Atlantic seizing slave ships. The crew were arrested, but what to do with the African captives? With the knowledge and consent of Wilberforce and friends, they were taken to Sierra Leone and put to slave labour in Freetown. They were called 'apprentices', but they were slaves. The governor of Sierra Leone paid the navy a bounty per head, put some of the men to work for the government, and sold the rest to landowners. They did forced labour, under threat of punishment, without pay, and those who escaped to neighbouring African villages to work for wages were arrested and brought back". (49)

	...It gradually became clear that there were serious problems with the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act. British captains who were caught continuing the trade were fined £100 for every slave found on board. However, this law did not stop the British slave trade. In fact, the situation became worse. Now that the supply had officially ceased, the demand grew and with it the price of slaves. For high prices the traders were prepared to take the additional risks. If slave-ships were in danger of being captured by the British navy, captains often reduced the fines they had to pay by ordering the slaves to be thrown into the sea. (52) 

	...Some people involved in the anti-slave trade campaign such as Thomas Fowell Buxton, argued that the only way to end the suffering of the slaves was to make slavery illegal. "I now regret that I and those honourable friends who thought with me on this subject have not before attempted to put an end, not merely to the evils of the slave trade, but to the evils of slavery itself." (54)

	Wilberforce disagreed, he believed that at this time slaves were not ready to be granted their freedom. He pointed out in A Letter on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, Addressed to the Freeholders and other inhabitants of Yorkshire that: "It would be wrong to emancipate (the slaves). To grant freedom to them immediately, would be to insure not only their masters' ruin, but their own. They must (first) be trained and educated for freedom." (55)  

	...In 1824 Elizabeth Heyrick published her pamphlet Immediate not Gradual Abolition. In her pamphlet Heyrick argued passionately in favour of the immediate emancipation of the slaves in the British colonies. This differed from the official policy of the Anti-Slavery Society that believed in gradual abolition. She called this "the very masterpiece of satanic policy" and called for a boycott of the sugar produced on slave plantations. (58)

	In the pamphlet Heyrick attacked the "slow, cautious, accommodating measures" of the leaders like Wilberforce. "The perpetuation of slavery in our West India colonies is not an abstract question, to be settled between the government and the planters; it is one in which we are all implicated, we are all guilty of supporting and perpetuating slavery. The West Indian planter and the people of this country stand in the same moral relation to each other as the thief and receiver of stolen goods". (59) 

	The leadership of the organisation attempted to suppress information about the existence of this pamphlet and William Wilberforce gave out instructions for leaders of the movement not to speak on the same platforms as Heyrick and other women who favoured an immediate end to slavery. 


https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/aug/02/wilberforce-condoned-slavery-files-claim
	William Wilberforce 'condoned slavery', Colonial Office papers reveal

	...Colonial Office papers for Sierra Leone, the free colony established by Wilberforce and his "Clapham Sect" of social reformers as an ideal society where races mixed and slaves were free, reveal that slavery – albeit renamed "apprenticeship" – continued long after the 1807 act abolishing slave trading, with Wilberforce's knowledge.

	His condoning of the practice and his collusion in keeping it quiet conspired to ensure that Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, would be the last place in the British empire where Africans could still be legally bought and sold into forced labour.

	...As directors of the Sierra Leone Company, Wilberforce and his coterie effectively ran the colony. After the 1807 Slave Trade Act, which abolished the slave trade but not slavery, the Royal Navy started intercepting slaving ships, arresting crews and rescuing slaves.

	But, what to do with the rescued slaves? "They could have set them free. But what they did was hand them over to the authorities in Freetown," said Tomkins. Sierra Leone became a crown colony in 1808, but was still managed by Wilberforce and his friends. "So with their knowledge, and their acquiescence, the navy would hand the slaves over. Some the colony kept themselves, others they sold to landowners and they put them to slave labour."

	...Men and children were "indentured" for $20. Women were given away. They did not call them slaves, they were "apprentices" – not purchased, but "redeemed".

	They received no wages, just food. And those that escaped were recaptured, in irons. The only distinction between them as "slaves" and as "apprentices", was that they must be freed after 14 years.

	...The then governor of Sierra Leone, Thomas Perronet Thompson, a 25-year-old lieutenant, was so appalled he begged Wilberforce for an explanation. "I wish I had time to go into particulars respecting the difficulties which forced us into acquiescing in the system of apprenticing," was Wilberforce's reply.

	Thompson maintained that Wilberforce and the Sierra Leone Company had "by means of their agents become slave traders themselves". He threatened to blow the whistle, so he was sacked, with Wilberforce himself agreeing to the dismissal.

	"There is something deeply disappointing about it all," said Tomkins.

Charles Fox's last speech:


https://books.google.com/books?id=EbAvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA658


Called out House of Commons for paying lip service to abolition but not actually doing anything about it. After his speech a bill making slave trade illegal (though punishment only a fine) was passed 118 to 15, then Fox died three months later by "dropsy."

Fox pointed out there were a lot of MP's who would publicly agree slave trade was bad yet not do anything about it (Fox first introduced subject 18 years prior). Some would say slave trade effectively over by increased regulations, others I guess economic argument that slave populations wouldn't be able to be sustained without trade, and other dodgy arguments that Fox referrs to in his speech. Excuses by MPs for continuting slavery might give ballpark for how many agentura were in Parliament.

Given all the underhanded efforts to keep slave trade and depopulation of Africa going, and timing of death, Fox's death unusual. Said to have died of "dropsy" (edema) and there are a lot of poisons with that as a side-effect: https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-1Sfqsq1hb6RS4ZuT/The+Encyclopedia+Of+Poisons+And+Antidotes_djvu.txt

End of slave trade even without abolition of slavery important in that it was key component of depopulation of Africa and black people more generally. The slave trade took 2% of the population of Africa per year and from 18th to 20th century Africa population was stagnant of declining (graph on page 7):

http://mortenjerven.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AfricanPopulation.Methods.pdf
	External Slave Trade as a factor in African population(Manning 1979, 1982).For the Bight of Benin 1690 –1740, estimates in this work suggested that captive exports averaged over 2% of the regional population per year, which surely brought population decline. This raised the question of the demographic effects of enslavement more generally in Africa.


In the slave camps, many Africans would be killed and instead of letting them live and get married and have kids (marriage was illegal for slaves) they would die then slavers would bring in more. So trade was key part in mechanism for attack on Africa.

After slave trade and end of slavery mechanism for attack on Africa changed, think Boer part of that.

Components for attack on Africa probably beyond just depopulation, I guess generally would want to get psycopaths in government, industry, science, and positions of cultural influence and prevent a break-away from other civs with those already in place. In that sense Boer and Broederbond would have purpose beyond just killing Africans as they took over government and positions of power and subjugated the populace there.
