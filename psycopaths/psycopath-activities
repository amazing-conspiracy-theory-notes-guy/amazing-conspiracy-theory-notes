important that not just fucked up and freaky people become serial killers, do genocide--LaLaurie and Leopold were wealthy elite, well-spoken and popular socialites, Jeffrey MacDonald was voted "most popular" and "most likely to succeed" and football captain in High School (though maybe didn't do it?)

Ted Bundy maybe famous example of that, a lot of classic examples of psycopath behavior by him

------


in general whenever a breakdown in society happens, activities of psycopaths become more prominent

lawlessness in Conquistador holdings, basically inmates running asylum and few to keep a record

any war, famine, situations were resources for survival are scarce and people are desperate

	A study found that the kidnapped children suffered from panic attacks, nightmares involving kidnappings and death, and personality changes. Many developed fears of such things as "cars, the dark, the wind, the kitchen, mice, dogs and hippies,"[18] and one shot a Japanese tourist with a BB gun when the tourist's car broke down in front of his home.[19] Many of the children continued to report symptoms of trauma at least 25 years after the kidnapping, including substance abuse and depression, and a number have been imprisoned for "doing something controlling to somebody else."[20][21]

	Influential backing for parole of Chowchilla bus kidnappers

	...Parole officials have never found James Schoenfeld or Frederick Woods, both 59, suitable for release. But in an unusual development, their families and attorneys have obtained statements over the years from the original prosecutor, the trial judge and two key police investigators, all supporting parole.

	“This was a very serious, bad crime,” said Gary Dubcoff, a San Francisco attorney who represents Woods. “But we’re saying that you either believe in rehabilitation or you don’t.”

	The men have spent more than half their lives in prison after the kidnapping in their early 20s. The kidnappers, who were sons of wealthy families in Atherton and Woodside, have said they hoped to collect a $5 million ransom after they ran into financial trouble while attempting to restore the Rengstorff House in Mountain View.
