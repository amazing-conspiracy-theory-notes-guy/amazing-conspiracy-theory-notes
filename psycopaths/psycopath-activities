important that not just fucked up and freaky people become serial killers, do genocide--LaLaurie and Leopold were wealthy elite, well-spoken and popular socialites, Jeffrey MacDonald was voted "most popular" and "most likely to succeed" and football captain in High School (though maybe didn't do it?)

Ted Bundy maybe famous example of that, a lot of classic examples of psycopath behavior by him

------


in general whenever a breakdown in society happens, activities of psycopaths become more prominent

lawlessness in Conquistador holdings, basically inmates running asylum and few to keep a record

any war, famine, situations were resources for survival are scarce and people are desperate
