https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Chowchilla_kidnapping
	A study found that the kidnapped children suffered from panic attacks, nightmares involving kidnappings and death, and personality changes. Many developed fears of such things as "cars, the dark, the wind, the kitchen, mice, dogs and hippies,"[18] and one shot a Japanese tourist with a BB gun when the tourist's car broke down in front of his home.[19] Many of the children continued to report symptoms of trauma at least 25 years after the kidnapping, including substance abuse and depression, and a number have been imprisoned for "doing something controlling to somebody else."[20][21]

	Influential backing for parole of Chowchilla bus kidnappers

	...Parole officials have never found James Schoenfeld or Frederick Woods, both 59, suitable for release. But in an unusual development, their families and attorneys have obtained statements over the years from the original prosecutor, the trial judge and two key police investigators, all supporting parole.

	“This was a very serious, bad crime,” said Gary Dubcoff, a San Francisco attorney who represents Woods. “But we’re saying that you either believe in rehabilitation or you don’t.”

	The men have spent more than half their lives in prison after the kidnapping in their early 20s. The kidnappers, who were sons of wealthy families in Atherton and Woodside, have said they hoped to collect a $5 million ransom after they ran into financial trouble while attempting to restore the Rengstorff House in Mountain View.

	Why parole board voted to release Chowchilla kidnapper

	By Bob Egelko

	The crime was horrific, even by today’s standards, and remains a nightmare nearly 39 years later for its victims — 26 schoolchildren and their bus driver, kidnapped at gunpoint in the Madera County town of Chowchilla, driven 100 miles north to Livermore, stashed in an underground quarry and held for the purpose of extracting a $5 million ransom.

	But the law can be forgiving with the passage of time, even in a state with laws as punitive as California’s, and the evidence of that was manifest Wednesday when a panel of the state Board of Parole Hearings found the second of the three kidnappers, James Schoenfeld, 63, eligible for release from prison.

	Schoenfeld’s younger brother, Richard, was paroled in 2012. The third kidnapper, Fred Woods, has his next parole hearing scheduled this fall.

	...“Of course in a case like this there’s anger, a desire for ongoing punishment,” Handleman said Thursday. “James does not dispute that it’s a heinous crime. But people change. That’s the fundamental principle that having a parole law recognizes.”

	Traumatic memory

	One of the victims, Jennifer Brown Hyde, who was 9 when she and her 10-year-old brother were abducted, told the Fresno Bee that she’s not ready to forgive the kidnappers.

	“They stole my childhood and caused me immense emotional pain over the years,” said Brown Hyde, now a 48-year-old Tennessee resident, who told the newspaper she still has anxiety attacks in confined spaces. She said the board’s decision left her with “a feeling of injustice because we were told they would never get out.”

	It should be considered a continuing crime, Madera County District Attorney David Linn said Thursday.

	“My reason for objecting (to parole) is that there are still victims of that crime who are still suffering,” he said in an interview. “Once he’s out, that’ll make things worse for the victims.”



Handleman says "of course there's desire for ongoing punishment" motivated by anger, attorney Linn counters that it's a "continuing crime" and "victims are still suffering"

kindof sounds like psycopath viewpoint, that justice motivated by resentement

Linn argument doesn't make much sense, I guess paints victims in same light as wiki article as sensitive whiners

	
	...The Schoenfelds of Atherton and Woods, who lived in Portola Valley, commandeered the bus full of summer school students on a Chowchilla road in July 1976. The men, all in their early 20s and with no serious criminal records, told relatives they needed money to pay off a $30,000 home loan.

	They put bus driver Ed Ray and the children in vans, drove them to Livermore and forced them into a moving van they had buried in a quarry. They wrote a note seeking a $5 million ransom, but they took a nap and when they woke heard on the radio that their victims had dug their way out after 16 hours, led by Ray and two older boys.


comandeered schoolbus, put driver and children in vans, then put in van they had burried in a quarry. Wrote a note for $5 million ransom, took a nap, woke up and found they had escaped.


	...Richard Schoenfeld turned himself in eight days later, and the others were captured the following week. They were initially sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, but a state appeals court ruled in 1980 that all three were eligible for future release because none of the victims had been seriously injured — some scrapes and nosebleeds, and emotional trauma, but no substantial physical harm that would have mandated a no-parole sentence.

	...The state Supreme Court ruled in a separate case in 2008 that the parole board, which considers cases of murderers, kidnappers and others sentenced to life with the possibility of parole, could not rely on the seriousness of the original crime to deny release, but must instead find evidence that an inmate would be dangerous to the public if released today. 


??


	...“He’s 63 years old. He’s not going to go out and hijack another bus or commit another crime,” Handleman said. He said Schoenfeld, questioned at length by parole board members, repeatedly expressed remorse and promised to live “a life dedicated to making amends, with what he has left of his life, by living a law-abiding life.”

NY Times article when children found:

https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/17/archives/26-children-found-safe-after-being-kidnapped-from-bus-in-california.html?_r=0
	A spokesman for the sheriff's department there said that the bus driver, 55‐year‐old Frank Edward Ray, said the abductors were white men.

	One of them, said to be about 6 feet tall, wielded a chrome‐handled pistol and a sawed‐off shotgun during the abduction, the spokesman said.


Ray identified kidnappers, one with pistol and shotgun


	...A spokesman for the Livermore fire department said he had been told that two of the children had managed to dig out from under boards and gravel that had been used to hide the kidnap victims.

	He said he had also been told that the two had made their way through the Cal Rock Quarry until they found a night watchman who helped uncover the others.


NY Times reported spokesman saying van was buried under gravel and it was two children who dug out and got help


	...After the children were freed, the authorities attemped to stake out the site, on the possibility that the abductors would return. But the surveillance was thwarted by a crush of curiosity seekers drawn to the quarry by news of the recovery.

	“The bus made three stops after school—he never made the fourth stop,” said Lee Roy Tatom, superintendent of the Dairyland Union School District.

	As of late today, 24 hours after the disappearance, the authorities said they had received no communications demanding ransom for the children or providing any clue to the disappearance.


weren't able to stake out crime scene because of press coverage. Didn't get a ransom note as of 24 hours after disappearance


	...The authorities said they were not now working on the theory that he was a party to the disappearances.

	Mr. Ray's wife and another relative of his work at the local Bank of America, one of Chowchilla's two banks. For this reason, the police had the bank under surveillance. But they said there had been no communications to the bank seeking money in connection with the disappearance.

	Madera County Sheriff Ed Bates said his detectives had been alerted by an Orange, N.J., woman about a 1958 novel by Hugh Pentecost, “The Day the Children Vanished,” about a busload of children abducted as a ruse to lure the residents of a town called Clayton away from their homes and businesses so that a gang can rob a local bank.

	“We don't know if there's any connection, but we're looking at the book,” he said.


weird

why did tipster and NY times mention this?


	...“They're just common, everyday people,” Mr. Tatom, the superintendent, said. “They're the kind of people who don't wear ties, you know. They're the kind who wear blue jeans and a clean shirt and are good, hard‐working people. I don't think it is money they wear after. I just think it has something to do with a life for a life, but that's only a theory.”

	“I have my suspicions,” said Judy Hinesley, whose 7‐year‐old daughter, Sherry, is misssing. “It's a group of people who either wanted money, or publicity, or both, and they'll get it—look at all the reporters that are here. They're going to get the attention they want.”


kidnapees weren't wealthy, some wonder on motive


	...Parents Are Puzzled

	Mrs. Hinesley and her husband, a heavy‐equipment operator, stayed up last night at the sheriff's department substation here, the hub of the search effort, along with other parents.

	Chowchilla is one of scores of similar communities in the heart of the great Central Valley, one of the richest agricultural belts in the world. It is 256 miles northwest of Los Angeles and 150 miles southeast of San Francisco, and makes its living from cotton, corn, dairy products and other agricultural products.

	The authorities put together the following account of what they believe happened yesterday:

	About 175 pupils, from kindergarten through eighth grade, were picked up for school shortly before the summer session began at 8:45 A.M. After a morning of academic‐oriented classes—arithmetic, history and so forth—the pupils, as usual, (spent the afternoon in a variety of recreational pursuits, including a swimming outing for some.

	School ended at 3:45 P.M., and the bus driven by Mr. Ray left the Dairyland school, which is in a sparsely settled farming area 12 miles west of here.

	The bus made three stops to drop off children and continued on. About 4:15 P.M., for unknown reasons, it went off its normal route. Instead of turning right at an intersection leading to the fourth stop, it apparently continued west toward what is called the Berenda Slough.

	It was in the slough that the bus was found, at about 7 P.M., after parents began calling the school inquiring about their children.

	“It's a complete mystery,” Mr. Tatom said. “After the third stop, it appears the driver was stopped and he lost command of the bus.”

	“This thing had to be well organized. Whoever did it knew the route. He knew the timing, and lie knew the area very well. A lot of people wouldn't have known about that slough. It was well thought out, and the bus had to be maneuvered into that slough by someone who knew what he was doing.”

	Sheriff Bates said. “I guess I'm a fundamentalist on this, but I can't help but think anybody who would do this, who would take boys and girls and kidnap them, whatever their motive, can't help but be psychotic. Whether it is political, whether it is self‐serving, whether it is personal, I can't help but think it's psychotic.”


Bus started full (how many?), made three stops and let off children. Before fourth stop, went off normal route, took a different turn, later found in bushes in slough.

Appears driver was stopped and lost command of the bus after the third stop.

Would have to be well organized--kidnappers would have to know route, timing, and area very well.

Bus would have had to have been manuevered into slough by someone who knew what they were doing.

Sheriff suspected psychotic motive.

on Cowchila, CA:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chowchilla,_California#History
	The name "Chowchilla" is derived from the indigenous American tribe of Chaushila (the spelling is inconsistent in reference guides), a Yokut Indian tribe which once lived in the area. The name evidently translates as "murderers" and is apparently a reference to the warlike nature of the Chaushila tribe. It is also to be known among the Yokuts tribes later on to be associated with "bravery". The Chaushila Indians were inadvertently responsible for the first white men "discovering" Yosemite Valley, which occurred when they were being pursued by a band of whites. References to the tribe still abound in Chowchilla, and until 2016 the town's high school used the moniker "Redskins" as their mascot.

NY Times profile on Fred Woods:

https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/23/archives/quarry-owners-son-called-a-loner-fond-of-old-cars.html
	SAN FRANCISCO, July 22—Fred Newhall Woods, who is being sought for questioning in the investigation of the kidnapping of 26 schoolchildren and their bus driver in Chowchilla, is the scion of a prominent California family and has been described by acquaintances as a loner with a fascination for old cars, which he collected on a vast estate his family has owned for generations.

	Mr. Woods is a 1970 graduate of Woodside High School, 40 miles south of here. He is the son of Fred Nickerson Woods 3d, who owns the California Rock and Gravel Company, based here, and the quarry in Livermore where the schoolchildren and their driver, Franklin Edward Ray, dug themselves out of a buried moving van trailer last Friday after being entombed for 16 hours.

	The younger Mr. Woods, who is 25 years old, has been identified as the person who bought the trailer last November.

	Relative Is ‘Shocked

	Officials in the Alameda County Sheriff's Department also seek to question two friends of his, James L. Schoenfeld, 25, and his brother, Richard A. Schoenfeld, 22, the sons of an Atherton podiatrist, John Schoenfeld.

	Scott Newhall, a first cousin once removed of the younger Mr. Woods, said he was not surprised to hear that Mr. Woods had purchased the trailer, because of his penchant for collecting old vehicles. But he said he was “as shocked as anyone else that Fred is a suspect.”

	“The motivation bugs me,” said Mr. Newhall, former executive editor of The San Francisco Chronicle.

	Mr. Newhall, 62, now edits The Newhall Signal, a triweekly newspaper in a town 300 miles south of here named for his great‐grandfather, Henry M. Newhall, a Massachusetts businessman who his fortune here in the 19th century.

friend says Woods recently got married but marriage didn't last long


	...Worked at Quarry

	After graduating from high school, where he apparently was an average student, Mr. Woods took a job in the family business and worked at the quarry for a year and a half, loading and weighing trucks, according to workers there. The workers also said that he sometimes drove to work in an old taxicab that had 300,000 miles on the odometer.

	Mr. Woods used part of his grandmother Frances's 200acre “Hawthorne Estate” at 800 Los Trancos Street in Portola Valley to collect old cars and other things, including a train caboose, as his father, a 1938 graduate of Stanford University, had done.

	...Mr. Woods acquired a number of these vehicles apparently in a car restoration building he had set up with the Schoenfelds.

	Although several persons described Mr. Woods as “aloof,” a young man who said he was well‐acquainted with him described him and the Schoenfelds as “very straight, nice friendly guys—I can't imagine either one of them being involved in something like this.”


Woods and Schoenfelds seemed like nice and friendly guys

Portola Valley is near SF, 139 miles away from Cowchilla, and the Quarry also in bay area was 100 miles away. Unusual they picked Cowchilla and knew bus route and timing given how far away it was.

It was ascertained by others contemporary to the event that the kidnappers would have had to have known the area very well.

	Mass kidnaping feared by sheriff

	...Deputies and police scoured the farmlands around Chowchilla, search planes were out at dawn, volunteers joined on horseback and the FBi was called in. Parents gathered at the police station, life ceased its normal routine along the two blocks of the main street, and still, nearly 24 hours after the disappearance of the children and the driver, ther was no real clue as to why or how or where they might be.

	"It appears to be an abduction," Sheriff Ed Bates said. "We'll search the whole state if we have to. And if we have to, we'll search the entire United States."


kindof like that book?

but in general they got everyone searching and kidnappers would know they'd have a tough time finding them that way


issued statewide bulletin for up to three vans beleived travelling west

found two cotton swabs, cauze and a plastic cup 75 yards from abaondoned school bus, Sheriff Bates said "not satisfied" significant, "It could have been a case of littering by our people taking photographs."

found two sets of tracks on bus tracks, Bates said showed "somebody left the area after the bus was parked."

didn't find any blood or evidence of foul play on scene


parents started calling authorites late that afternoon


	...The sheriff's office said it received calls from anxious parents beginning about 4:15 p.m. Thursday. At that time, the bus was two hours overdue.

	...Parents, expecting their children home for supper after a day of swimming and playing, started calling authorities late yesterday afternoon. As the evening wore on, they gathered in the police station lounge, sipping coffee as they waited for some word about their sons and daughters.

	Some joined this morning in the widespread search for the children in autos and on horseback.

some gathered in police station, others went on search, others waited all night

	
	...The Diarlyand Unified School district bus was found 4 miles south of Chowchilla, a San Joaquin Valley farm community of 4,500 with a mainstreet barely two blocks long. Fields of dense corn and other crops and occasional orchards of fruit and nut trees stretch in all directions around the tiny town.

	There are 150 to 155 students in summer school at the Dairyland, about 8 miles south of Chowchilla.

	Principal Lee Roy Tatom said today was to have been the last day of the session.

	The FBI today joined an intensive investigation for 26 children and their schoolbus driver who were apparently victims of a mass kidnaping.

	President Ford asked the FBI for a written report, and wants to be kept personally informed.

	...Reports of armed men following schoolbuses were made to the Madera County Sheriff's Department a year ago, and now were being checked out.


President Ford and FBI were interested in case

Madera county had gotten tips of armed men following schoolbuses a year earlier



UPI article on same 16 Jul:


https://www.newspapers.com/image/2387706/?terms=Chowchilla

some initially thought radical group or terrorists

dust patterns led investigators to believe bus was empty at time it was abandoned


	...In brush about 75 yards from the bus, searchers found cotton swabs and guaze in a plastic bottle. It appeard someone had been sitting near where the bottle was found, Deputy Sheriff James Christopher said.


a little different from AP article (why?)

	
	...Tracks from perhaps two vehicles besides the bus were found at the scene, but a heavy rain during the night hampered the investigation. Authorities said the area often is used by hunters, which might explain the tire tracks.


AP different, doesn't mention dust thing, talks about signs of vioence at scene in context of gauze and "plastic cup" found there, says tire tracks might be from criminals leaving scene


	...Although the evidence pointed to the likelihood of a kidnapping, authorities were baffled because there had been no ransom notes or phone calls.

	The FBI sent six agents to the scene from its Sacramento office, but Paul C. Young, special agent in charge, said there was no legal basis to declare the disappearance and kidnapping and that the agents were only offering assistance and were not officially assigned to the case.


Why FBI jump on it in this way? maybe important, another article said FBI was there to "determine if this was a federal crime kidnapping"

3 children dropped off before bus was reported missing


same author Frank Del Olmo page 2:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/383016047
	Investigators found it had been parked behind the bamboo so that it was screened from a little used road. Dust on the seats and the lack of many footprints on the ground convinced Madera County Sheriff Ed Bates that the children had been taken off the bus elsewhere.


a little weird compared to AP article if Bates was convinced of this


	...But the FBI, which generally enters only those kdinaping cases in which there is evidence or presumption that a state line has been crossed, began flying agents in from Sacramento and Los Angles this morning.


FBI involvement also maybe unusual

also says Ford "quite concerned"--worth checking if had anything to do with politics and Ford? e.g. "we will tell you where they are if you do X but otherwise all the children will die"

was some watergate stuff concurrent to this

were this the case, psycopaths would approve of this and emphasize danger the children were in since they would feel they could blame Ford if something happened to them

probably would be hard to find things pointing to this in press though


	...There was even the theory--Thursday being the next to last day of summer school--that it was some prank that had been carried too far.

	But Bates, who has been in Naval Intelligence and several law enforcement agents before taking over in Madera County, said:

	"The Thing that really broke me up, thinking about it," he said, "was those kids out there with that thunder and lightning."

	...James Esterbrook, 28, a factor press operator whose 8-year-old son, John, was on the bus, tried desperately to make some sense of the mystery.

	"This is just a small town," he said. "There is no reason for vengeance . . . We have no power in this community or anything like that. I don't know what they want from me."


how did subject of vengeance come up in interview? weird since most wouldn't think vengeance would be dealt against children

maybe related to the bit in wiki article about native American tribe there before...?

dunno but generally psycopaths convince themselves that their victims deserve it, so this is important


	As the mystery deepened throughout an eerie night of rain, lightning and thunder, parents called or came to the Chowchilla police station just off the two-block-long main street.

	"There must be a logcial explanation," murmured Sam Barletta, father of 12-year-old Lista, one of the missing children. "It seems so damn strange. I haven't faced reality yet."

	...The parents apparently shared the feeling that whoever was responsible for the disappeareance of their children, it was not the bus driver, Frank Edward Ray Jr., 55.

	"Many people my age can remember when he drove them to school," said Bill Parker.

	Ray was described by local resident Bonnie Perez as "very sweet and responsible. He's the sweetest of all the bus drivers. He'd do anything for those kids and they'd do anything for him."

	...Sheriff Bates lost no time asking the state attorney general's office to go to its computer system for a print-out of possible suspects in a crime against a school bus full of children.

	Authorities knew in advance what one profile would be: that of the so-called Zodiac who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area during 1968, 1969, and 1970 by bragging of killing 17 people.

	Police have definitely linked him to six murders.

	On Oct. 17, 1969, the San Francisco Chronicle got a letter from the Zodiac in which he threatened to kill a busload of children.

	"Schoolchildren make nice targets," he wrote. "I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire and then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out."

	Buses were placed under guard for a time in various Bay Area counties.

	The Zodiac was never caugh and has not been heard from since 1971.

	A 1971 Clint Eastwood firm, "Dirty-Harry," obviously based on the Zodiac case, had the psycopathic killer hijacking a bus filled with children.


Frank Del Olmo article has some anomalies, maybe he is a psycopath

unusual that he uses a lot of the article to emphasize the terror and confusion of the children's parents and the populace, also weird turns of phrase and things he chooses to mention

like ending article "by the way it could be Zodiac Killer isn't it scary???"

	Children Found, Suspects Sought

	CHOWCHILLA, Calif. (AP)-- Twenty-six children and their school bus driver returned home early today, weary but unhurt, ending a bizarre but still unexplained 36-hour mass kidnaping odyssey.

	There was no certain word of a motive, but an all-points bulletin was issued for thee unidentified men who abducted the 27 at gunpoint near Chowchilla Thursday afternoon.

	...THe 26 children and a bus driver Frank Edward Ray Jr. escaped Friday night from a partially buried truck body, nearly 100 miles north of here, where the three men imprisoned them about 4 a.m. Friday.

	Ray, his crewcut still laced with dirt and grime, told reports today that the children screamed and shouted "Why? Why?" as the masked men shut them in the truck and started piling dirt on top of it.

	There was no answer.

	Ray said it was dark in the truck, but the men had left him a flashlight. A small hole in the roof of the truck appeared to be the only escape. The abductors had covered the whole with steel and wood and weighted it down with a large battery.

	Ray said he and two of the boys piled up matresses and used a piece of wood to clear the hole.

	"It was just lucky I found a block of wood 18 inches long and I used it as a pry," Ray said.

	The bus driver said Robert Gonzales, 11, was the first ouf of the truck, and Michael Marshall, 14, helped Ray pass the other children out of the truck body.

	Ray said that when all were free, they walked about 200 yards to a gravel quarry, where they found a maintenance man who called the Alameda County sheriff's office.

	Ray said the three masked men rarely spoke, asking only for names and ages and telling their captives to hand over some of their clothing. Some were left only in their underwear.

kindof weird

planned all that out, but left mattresses and peice of wood to pry them out in the van. Did they want them to escape?


	
	...Bill Auffarth, a registered nurse, accompanied the children, whose ages ranged from 6 to 14. He said they told him their captors treated them nicely, providing them with potato chips, soup, cereal and water.

	..."The locked us in a big pit and we had to dig our way out," Mike Marshall, 14, told reporters.

	The bus driver, who is 55, gave more details later. He said dirt began falling on the captives as they tried to dig out, and that was the most frightening point.

	Chowchilla Mayor Jim Dumas also said that captives "had problems with air. They poured water on each other to keep them from suffocating."

	...Dumas said that at about the time the children escaped, the Almeda County sheriff's office received a call from an unidentified woman who said "Livermore can become famous" if deputies went to the quarry because the missing children were there.

	The mayor also said that while he was away Friday evening, his wife received a call from an unidentified woman who said, "The kids have been found, but it's not over.... There will be others."

	There was no immediate comment from investigators about the call.

	"Don't worry," soothed one of the friends. "It's fun. They ask you a lot of questions and then they give you stuff."


guess "it's fun" referring to FBI questioning, not being kidnapped...


	The FBI interrogated the children throughout the early morning hours, trying to solve the puzzle of what happened and why. Through the windows of the long building, the small heads of children could be seen poking above huge desks in brightly-illuminated offices. "They gave us very good descriptions of the suspects," an agent said. "They were very attentive and very cooperative."

	Piles of sneakers and shorts and jeans packed tightly in fishnet bags covered the floor. The children ran obstacle courses through the laundry, laughing, screaming with pleasure. It was a celebration of life to help them forget the terrors of the long night before.


got description of suspects from children (what about bus driver?)


main UPI article on it:


	Kidnapers sought

	26 abducted children safe; found in quarry

	The 26 children abducted with their school bus driver at gun point were safe at home with their families today. The heroci driver told a press conference about the bizarre events leading up to the kidnaping and the 26-hour ordea in an underground cavern.

	Driver Frank 3. Ray, 55, said that he and some of the older boys among the schoolchildren never stopped digging until they were out of the underground prison at a rock quarry a few miles east of LIvermore.

	"We thought were were going to die," Ray said. "The kids did a lot of crying and begging for their mommas. We thought they were going to suffocate us."

	The strain of 50 sleepless hours showing on his florid, drawn face, the Madera County School District driver explained how he and the elementary school children were abducted by three white gunmen.

	As Ray drove the children home from a swimming outing Thursday a white van blocked the small rural road.

	"I slowed to pass it and a man stepped out with two guns, then two other men stepped out," Ray said. "There were two vans. They ordered me to get into one of them."

	The children were divided into groups, placed in the vans with covered windows and one of the abductors drove the bus to a secluded drainage ditch where it was hidden.

	Abductors Escape as FBI, Police Storm Rock Quarry

	BY JERRY COHEN and FRANK DEL OLMO

	CHOWCHILLA--Twenty-six kidnapped children and their bus driver were rescued Friday night at a rock qarry near Livermore as their two abductors were digging a trench presumably in preparation for killing and burying them.

	Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally announced the development at a news conference here.

	The persons who abducted the 19 girls, deven boys and the bus driver here Thursday afternoon reportedly escaped as FBI agents and Alameda County deputy sheriffs stormed the quarry.

	They were being sought in the LIvermore area.

	Two vans used to transport the victims from Chowchilla to the quarry 95 miles away were found at the quarry.

	One report said several of the youngsters were already in the ditch and apparently were about to be killed and buried when FBI agents and deputies arrived at the California Rock Co. quarry on Stalney Road west of Livermore.


different from AP and UPI, this says two abdoctors digging trench while FBI and police rescued them

this was announced in press conference in LA? or in Chowchilla probably

"one report" says FBI arrived right as children already in ditch were apparently about to be killed (?)

Dymally said someone who lived near quarry noticed something suspicious and phoned police


why completely different story on how they were rescued?

	
	...Carol Marshall, mother of the oldest kidnaped youngster, Micael, 14, blurted out:

	"I couldn't believe it. It was just the same as when they were taken. I couldn't believe that either."

	Mrs. Marshall said the abductors should get the "absolute maximum" penalty, "whatever is available."

	...One of the parents said earlier that the abductors "should be hung from the nearest tree" when found.

	Janice Park, mother of the two of the kidnaped children, said she also hoped the abductors would get thd eath penalty.

	"I don't want to see this happen to anyone else," Mrs. Park said. 

	...Up until the announcement, the parents of the hcildren had sat by their telephones, as summer thunder rumbled ominously, waiting for some word as to the fate of their children.

	But except for the cracking of the lightning there was only slience. The phones never rang. There were no demands for ransom, no instructions from terrorists.

	At a prayer meeting in the little white stucco First Baptist Church in the center of town, an old man stood up and, as the thunder clapped, cried out to God:

	"Lord, it looks like Thou has piced this little town of Chowchilla for an awakening that we may honor and worship You with more sincerity, and that we may get back on the right path with Thee."


also reports that a man in a fedora was seen giving money to children (?), found some clothes on highway and 1.5 miles from bus


	...In Washington, President Ford received a page-and-a-half report on the case from the FBI. The President instructed Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi to use all available FBI and government agency resources to find the children and the driver.

	...In one of several press conferences during the long, rainy night, Bates said he believed there had been an "abduction"--but he refrained from using the term "kidnaping" because there had been no ransom demand.

	But the FBI, which generally enters only those kidnaping cases in which there is evidence of presumption that a state line had been crossed, began flying agents in from Sacramento and Los Angeles this morning.


wonder what would have happened if FBI didn't get involved? would press have stressed there was no ransom?


rest of article is copy of old one, ends with Zodiac killer thing


Jerry Cohen article on pg 21 unusual, weird dropping references to religion, emphasizing fear and wondering motive, vengeance, and the native American tribe that was there before: https://www.newspapers.com/image/383017685/


another AP article:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/57087138/
	By then, some of the children had dug their way through the cavern opening, Houchins said.

	(The New York Times quoted a spokesman for the Livermore Fire Department as saying he had been told that two of the children had managed to dig out from under board and gravel that had been used to hide the kidnap victims. He said he had also been told that the two had made their way through the Cal Rock Quarry until the y found a nigh watchman who helped uncover the others.)


Other reports say it was Ray who did most of digging, "wandered" around quary until found watchman


NY Times article on same day doesn't say Ray helped dig out or find watchman, also says:

https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/17/archives/26-children-found-safe-after-being-kidnapped-from-bus-in-california.html?_r=0
	By ROBERT LINDSEY

	...The authorities said 19 girls and seven boys, 6 to 14 years had been on the bus when it was seized. Mr. Ray, the driver, has worked for the school district for 26 years. The authorities said they were not now working on the theory that he was a party to the disappearances.

	Mr. Ray's wife and another relative of his work at the local Bank of America, one of Chowchilla's two banks. For this reason, the police had the bank under surveillance. But they said there had been no communications to the bank seeking money in connection with the disappearance.

	Madera County Sheriff Ed Bates said his detectives had been alerted by an Orange, N.J., woman about a 1958 novel by Hugh Pentecost, “The Day the Children Vanished,” about a busload of children abducted as a ruse to lure the residents of a town called Clayton away from their homes and businesses so that a gang can rob a local bank.

	“We don't know if there's any connection, but we're looking at the book,” he said.


so AP recounts Ray digging them out, UPI says Ray a hero, NY Times throws suspicion on him and LA Times says it was all cops and FBI descending on fleeing perps without mentioning Ray digging them out

maybe they were angry Ray the bus driver thwarted their plans


more AP reporting 17 Jul:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/57087140/
	Depuy DIck Jayne of the Alameda County sheriff's office said the children had been at the quarry since 3:30 a.m. Friday. Jayne said the bus driver had told authorities that the group was greeted at the quarry with "potato chips and refreshments."

	He declined to explain how the children were detained.

	He said the driver, Ed Ray, was being questioned by authorities, "although he is not a suspect at this time."

	He said deputies had received an anonymous tip that the children might be in the quarry, although he said neighbors across the street from the scene had noticed nothing unusual.


many articles giving different accounts

LA Times Olmo article says:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/383017544/	
	Dymally said a person who lives near the quarry noticed supsicious activity around the quarry and telephoned deputy sheriffs


opposed to this, says got anonymous tip, "though neighbors across the street" noticed nothing unusual

where both these articles after Dymally press conference?

	
	...Bates said earlier, "My reading is we have a mysterious disappearance. There's no indications of foul play, no indication of scuffling. Yet, the children are gone. Maybe they did it with persuasion. I don't know how you get 26 kids to do your bidding without a great deal of planning."



Chicago Tribune on Jul 17 reports it as neighbor called in suspicious activity in quarry:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/383773919/?terms=Chowchilla
	By Roland Koziol

	...Without going down into the quarry, police set up a surveillance perimitter around the area, suspecting corecctly that the suspicious activity was connected with the kidnaped children.

	However, after a short time, investigators said, police felt that the abductors had been tipped off to their strategy, possibly by monitoring the police radio, and they moved in on the vans. They found the children locked inside.

	ALTHOUGH NO ransom note or other demands were ever received from the kidnapers, investigators are toying with a theory that they might be connected with some terrorist group operating in the politically volatile Bay Area of San Francisco.

	It could, be, investigators speculate, that the kidnapers intended to exchange the children for some well-known prisoners, perhaps Patricia Hearst, William and Emily Harris, or others.

	In Chowchilla, Madera County Sheriff Ed Bates said the possibility of a terrorist-oriented kidnaping was baffling because "the central valley of California is relatively unsophisticated in gureila warfare."


article has no mention of kids digging themselves out

puts forth idea "maybe they were politically-motivated terrorists"


also has front page article on similarity to "Day the Children Vanished" novel

	...The DETECTIVE story's kidnaping motive is not ransom, but is a ruse to lure the people of Clayton, a small mining town, away from their homes and businesses while a gang robs the local bank.

	...Mahoney also is the father of the book's bus driver who, like the man in the Chowchilla case, was known as a model of reliability.


AP also had article on similarities, said police were reading it: https://www.newspapers.com/image/34137100/

	Bus Driver Tells of Kidnap, Terror, Escape

	BY ALTON SLAGLE

	New York News

	CHOWCHILLA, Calif. -- He thought at one point that they must be trying to kill them, the 27 of them crammed together in a hot airless, half-buried truck trailer. They could hear the hated men above them slowly, deliberately cut the metal mesh and canvas that formed a roof and held back the heavy soil and rock piled atop it.

	The dirt and the rocks began cascading down on the crying, scared-to-death youngsters and Ed Ray.

	Then it stopped. The sound of shoes above them ceased. They waited for what seemed like an eternity in the dark steaming trailer.


Ray says perps cut a hole in the van and let dirt in, then left

why would they do that?

	
	...This is his story:

	"I left Dairyland School about 10 minutes to 4 with my busload of kids. I left off two stops, left off another stop and then came back on Avenue 21. There was a white van parked down the road with the door open and I slowed up because he was over the white line.

	"I slowed up to go around him and out jumped a man with two guns and a mask on. He ordered me to open my door, the other two guys jumped out of the van, on of 'em ordered me to the back seat and the other one took over my bus. He continued on down the road for about a mile, then he turned into the slough (dry creek) bottom, into the tules (reeds) with my bus with all the kids on it.

	"The white van pulled up by my door, backed up and ordered about half the kids in. Then they pulled the black one up and loaded the rest of 'em. I was on the back van. It was just solid black in there.

	"We got stuck, I thought he wasn't gonna' get out but he got out and he traveled and traveled and traveled to get to where we were.

	"We got to this one spot, he runs through some brush and stuff, I hear it scratching the van. He left the cooler on for a while, and they he shut it off. We hought we was gonna' suffocate in there for a while. I pulled the carpet loose to try to get air

	"THEN ABOUT 3:30 in the morning, he backed the van up to this thing that was all canvassed over. He unloaded us through the back door. He wanted the bus driver first, so I got out and he asked me my name and my age. Then he wanted my pants and my boots so I had to give him that.

	"Then he unloaded all the kids and asked for a name and age. He gave me a flashlight and I had to help the kids down through this about a three-fot hole down into this old building, old truck body I guess it was. When they got through, they pulled the ladder up and put a big steel plate over the hole, so there we was down there.

	"They had some food and some water for us, some Cheerios and 'tater chips, plent of water and a couple of loaves of bread.

	"They had this building (the truck trailer) all lined with big ol' mesh wire. THey stood on the outside and we cuould hear them cutting the wires and the ceiling started to cave in. We thought we were gonna' have it right then. We kept beggin' them to let us out.

	"In the afternoon we never did hear 'em cutting the wires no more, so me and a couple of the boys decided we'd better start diggin. When we started to move this steel plate, we couldn't hardly move it because it had two great big ol' batteries on top of it. One of the batteries I couldn't even lift myself. I had to get the kids to help me. We had to pile up mattresses and stuff to get as close enough to the whole to get out.

	"They had another big box filled about 30 inches high. They had dirt piled on each side and the top and we couldn't start to move it. It's just lucky we had a short block of wood in a thing there they had for a brace, and we used it to pry.

	"We'd throw water over our heads to try to cool off and go up and dig some more. I'd say it was about 7 o'clock we got dug out. I handed the kids up to the other boys and we got out. Just lucky enough there was a gravel pit there within 200 feet of us and there was a man over there so we told him what happened. He want and called the sheriff, and the seriffs and the fire trucks and everything else came and we had a big crowd and we all got home safe."

	...The abductors had cut small hoes in the metal sides of the 8- by 16-foot prison so that the children could have a toilet of sorts. But the air inside was stifling, and, Ray said, it became increasingly difficult to breathe.

	He said the kidnappers said nothing to him except to ask his name and, "I never did as much as hear 'em speak to one another."

	But the frightened children made up for it, "and I just talked to 'em and begged 'em not to holler and screme that we're gonna' try to get out of here."

	...When they started cutting the wire mesh, and the dirt started caving in, Ray became fearful that the men meant to kill their prisoners. "That's the only thing I thought about," he said.



bus driver Ray account:

Slowed down from white van with door open on the road.

man with two guns and a mask jumped out and ordered Ray to open the door.

Then two other guys jumped out of the van, one ordered him to back seat and the other started driving the bus. They drove to the slough with all the kids in the bus.

The white van pulled up by the door and ordered half the kids in. Then the black van pulled up for the other half and Ray.

The van was solid black inside. They got stuck for awhile, then traveled a long time to the quarry.

At one point the van was in a spot with foliage that Ray could hear scraping the side of the van. The driver shut of the cooler and they thought they were going to suffocate. Ray pulled apart the carpet to try to get some air.

Then at 3:30 AM, he backed the van up to a structure that was canvassed over. He unloaded Ray first, asked him his name and age, and took his boots and pants.

They entered down a three foot hole on a ladder. They gave Ray a flashlight, and he had to help each kid as they were unloaded, and the kidnappers asked each their name and age. Then they pulled up the ladder and put a steel plate over the hole.

Inside was some food and water, Cheerios, potato chips, and some loaves of bread.

The structure was lined with mesh wire. They stood outside and Ray and the kids could hear them cutting the wires and the ceiling started to cave in. Ray and the kids thought they were going to die and begged them to let them out.

In the afternoon they didn't hear them cutting the wires anymore, and Ray and two boys decided to start digging. It was hard to move the steel plate because it had two heavy batteries on top, and Ray couldn't move it without the kids help. They had to pile mattresses and other things to get close enough to get out. They also (I think?) moved a box filled with dirt with thing they found for a pry.

They threw water on their heads to cool off and kept digging, getting out about 7 o'clock. Ray handed the kids to the other boys and they all got out (sounds like saying all got out from context). They found a man at a gravel pit and told him what happened. He called the sheriff and the police and a huge crowd came and they all got home safe.



not sure when/where this was said, but was known to AP by 17th:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/246164790/?terms=Chowchilla
	Ray said he and two of the boys piled up matresses and used a piece of wood to clear the hole.

	"It was just lucky I found a block of wood 18 inches long and I used it as a pry," Ray said.


unusual that says this in same article:

	
	...Bill Auffarth, a registered nurse, accompanied the children, whose ages ranged from 6 to 14. He said they told him their captors treated them nicely, providing them with potato chips, soup, cereal and water.

	..."The locked us in a big pit and we had to dig our way out," Mike Marshall, 14, told reporters.

	The bus driver, who is 55, gave more details later. He said dirt began falling on the captives as they tried to dig out, and that was the most frightening point.


got impression kidnappers were handing out potato chips, different from first-hand account of incident

would figure ceiling caving in as they cut wires would be "most frightening point", as Ray said, but this isn't mentioned in the article.


UPI article had bit about cutting wires and cave in, calls Ray a hero:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/15448155/?terms=Chowchilla


LA Times article doesn't mention Ray efforts at all, says cops found them with some in ditch dug by perps maybe about to be killed, ads bit about creepy guy with fedora with feather in it giving money to children and ends with zodiac killer bit from before:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/15448155/?terms=Chowchilla


similar to Chicago tribune, says neighbor called in and no mention of Ray:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/383773919/?terms=Chowchilla



before this: some earlier reports emphasized that the children were probably taken from bus before being driven to slough, contradicting Ray's statement

NY Times and other articles pushed idea of copy-cat crime of book where criminals kidnap school bus of kids to distract to rob bank, then point out Ray's relative worked at a local bank and implicated him that way


guess so far what probably happened:

In 1920's Nathan Leopold invented idea of "haha you were searching for your kid but your kid's dead," psycopaths marveled at this

imitated in 2nd "crime of the century" with kidnapping of Lindbergh's kid

but these three wealthy nobles were going to top them all, the true crime of the century

they kidnapped a school bus full of kids, brought to quarry they rigged to have roof collapse after cutting some wires

they wanted to get away with it, so they made Ray take off his pants and boots to be buried with them

Meanwhile, de Olmo and others wrote articles raising fear of serial killers, pedophiles, and all sorts of things public stereotypically frets about. There's the Zodiac killer and a guy with feather in fedora giving money to children--"who can you trust?" as one headline put it

but plan hit a snag--Ray and the kids were able to force open door and dig out, what they put on wasn't heavy enough with Ray and kids making levers and fulcrum and all sorts of things to get out.

Ray gets out and contacts a man watching over site--now it's clear word is going to get out one way or another

So, multiple people call in to give tip to police, perhaps ahead of Ray--this way, can argue Ray not the one who tipped off police, and can still frame him (as NY Times attempted to do)
