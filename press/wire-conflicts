	...Which wire service to use? Invariably on breaking stories about plane crashes, earthquakes or other tragedies, the news services do not agree on all the details. As editors we've come to expect it, though it does give us some anxious moments. The differences are understandable: Reporters are interviewing different people - hospital officials, police agencies, administrators - and of-ten their numbers don't add up. Most differences can be resolved simply by analyzing the story itself.

	One that leaps to mind involves last spring's Soviet submarine that surfaced off Norway with nuclear reactor trouble. Reading the three services it was easy to tell who had the best vantage: UPI was writing its story from Washington, based on Pentagon reports. AP was collecting information from its bureaus in London and Moscow. Reuters had a reporter/photographer aboard a rescue helicopter hovering overhead. We used Reuters.

	Other calls aren't so easy. Sometimes it requires a query to the local bureau, or, rarely, a call to the general news desks in New York.

	Soviet Submarine Sinks off Norway

advanced sub caught fire, sunk, quote U.S. official "major loss of life"

	...At the Soviet Embassy in Oslo, a spokesman early today said the submarine sank but gave no other information, Reuters news agency reported, quoting the Norweigian news agency NTB.

	...Believed One of a Kind

	The accident involving the submarine, believed to be the only one of its kind, may provide an intelligence bonanza for the United States and its allies if reconnaisance ships, aircraft, or satellites were able to take detailed, close-up photographs of the rare craft as it surfaced.

	The Norwegian Defense Minister said that Soviet ships and aircraft were in the area where the sub was lost, in international waters off Spitsbergen Island near the Arctic Circle.

	The statement said Norwegian military aircraft had flown over the area, about 300 miles from North Cape on the Norwegian mainland, and had seen the submarine ablaze. Officials said the fire appeared to be concentrated in the stern, or rear, of the vessel, where water distillation equipment and propulsion machinery are housed.


believed one of a kind, "intelligence bonanza" if U.S. and allies got pictures as it surfaced, Norwegian defence minister statement said Norwegian military aircraft flew over area and observed, Norwegian officials reported where fire located on craft

	
	..."We have observed bodies," Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst told NTB. "We do not yet have an exact figure."

	In an interview broadcast on Britain's Independent Televsion News, Norwegian Defense Ministry spokesman COl. Gullow Gjeseth said that in a flight over the submarine, "I saw at the time two dinghies, with the personnell in one dinghy. We saw also a Soviet merchant ship in the area and we know also Soviet aircraft have been over the area."


norwegian defense personnel saw bodies, dunno how many, saw dinghies, saw Soviet merchant ship and aircraft, and told this to press

on tech of sub, designed for "cat and mouse game". "Special design," "unique propulsian system," double-hulled titanium, carry up to 6 nuke torpedoes


	...White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials had little information on the incident Friday night.

	"There are indications there was a major fire aboard, but we have no details. We understand there has been a loss of life but we can't confirm how many," Fitzwater said. "We express the sympathy of the United States government to the Soviet government for any loss of life involved." President Bush had been notified of the accident, Fitzwater said.

	The area of the sinking in the Norwegian Sea is the site of many naval exercises by both Eastern and Western forces and is considered a potential battleground in the event of a large-scale conflict. Western forces practice keeping Soviet submarines away from Atlantic shipping lanes, while Soviet vessels patrol there to keep track of Western ships.

	One analyst said that before sinking, the submarine could have released its ballast, causing the ship to pop up high on the surface of the ocean, exposing some of the sub's underside.

	"This really could be an intelligence coup," said one American naval analyst. When a disabled Soviet Victor-class submarine surfaced off Newport, R.I., in the mid-1980's, analysts reaped a harvest of valuable intelligence.

	But the accident poses potentialy severe environment hazards as well. Previous submarine accidents have resulted in release of radiation, and in 1961 members of a Soviet submarine crew died of radiation poisoning after an accident in the Baltic, according to recently declassified CIA documents.


makes it sound like CIA did it to get intelligence

	Nuclear-powred Soviet sub apparently sinks near Norway

	By NORMAN BLACK
	Associated Press

	WASHINGTON -- A nuclear-powered Soviet submarine appears to have sunk more than 300 miles off the coast of Norway after suffering an underwater accident and catching fire, U.S. and Norwegian officials said yesterday.

	U.S. officials said there "definitely" were casualties on board the submarine, but they declined to estimate how many.

	They said that the submarine managed to surface for a time after the accident in the Norwegian Sea, and that at least one Soviet ship had responded to a distress call and arrived on the scene.

	"It was on the surface, but now it appears it's gone," one official said on condition of anonymity. "We're trying to get confirmation, but we believe it sank."


quoting a bunch of anonymous officials who won't even say for sure it sank

"it was on the surface, but now it appears it's gone"

goes on to quote Fitzwater sympathy for "any loss of life involved"


one U.S. source gives last known location

another says dunno what caused it

quotes "nuclear specialist" saying reactor "inherently very dangerous"


	...Col. Gollow Gjeseth, press spokesman of Norway's Subpreme Defense Command, said in a telephne interview that a Norwegian observation plane sent over the area saw "a Soviet ship and two rubber boats."

	...The agency said people had been sighted in at least one of the rubber boats, but it was not clear if the boats were from the submarine or from one of the surface vessels.


not meantioning saw bodies as in LA times article? WH spokesman and officials quotes strange given this, "sorry for any loss of life involved"

us sources say no U.S. ships in area or request from Soviets for assistance

goes over "Mike class", unique, some prior Soviet sub accidents

	
	...Jan Bremer, author of the recently published book "Soviet Submarines," says the high accident rate can be traced to poor construction and design, poor maintenance mthods and insufficient training.


goes on about crew training

	
	...Another factor is the dangerous liquid fuel the Soviets use to power their submarine-based missiles. U.S. missile submarines use solid-fuel rockets.


implying the fuel was source of fire?

something similar came up with U.S. vs NK missile program, some journalists writing as if U.S. blowing up rockets and fuel mentioned iirc

	
	Evidence of poor submarine construction on Soviet submarines was uncovered in 194 when the CIA-operated Glomar Explorer succeeded in raising on section of a sunken Golf II submarine.


trying to rub it in? Glomar Explorer was sore-point to Soviets

	
	"Hull thickness varied widely, and welds were uneven and dangerously pitted," Bremer wrote. "Most surprising was the use of four-by-two wooden beams for internal structural support."

	U.S. Defense Department officials have long asserted that the Russian navy does not attach as much importance to the safety of its nuclear operations as do Western navies.


why write this in article on Soviet sailors who just died?

quotes Arikin again "inherently very dangerous", ends with if reactor "could be quite catastrophic."

	Soviet sub burns, sinks near Norway

	...A large nuclear powered Soviet submarine caught fire and sank in an underwater accident in the Norwegian Sea and a dozen crewmen were feared dead.

	A Soviet embassy spokesman in Oslo confirmed Friday's sinking but gave no other information, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported today.

	U.S. officials said they did not know when the accident occured or if either of the vessel's nuclear reactors were involved. Soviet ships and aircraft were dispatched to the area, about 310 miles north of North Cape in Norway.


why couldn't AP include spokespan confirming ship sunk?

	
	ABC News reported Friday, quoting unnamed Pentagon sources, that as many as a dozen people were killed in the fire, while others were rescued by Soviet ships. The submarine is believed to carry a crew of 95, according to the reference book "Jane's Fighting Ships."


or include previous night APC report that up to a dozen killed in the fire?

Navy officials say reactors dangerous

Fitzwater saying fire aboard, no details, understand loss of life dunno how many

	
	..."We express the sympathy of the United States government to the Soviet government for any loss of life involved," he said, adding that President George Bush had been informed of the accident.

	"We have observed bodies," Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst told NTB, "We do not yet have an exact figure."

	Holst added, "We know it was nuclear-powered and probably had nuclear weapons on board. ...It is clearly a very serious accident."


goes over region with Soviet patrols, some info on Mike class

paragraph on ABC report is from AP article...


	..."It was on the surface, but now it appears it's gone," said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We're trying to get confirmation, but we believe it sunk."


goes on with much of same paragraphs from Courier Journal printing, adds:

	
	...The sources declined to say when or how the United States first became aware of the submarine's problems.

	But ABC News reported that Pentagon sources said U.S. intelligence learned of the accident through electronic intercepts of communications from the stricken submarine.

	Soviet sub burns, sinks off Norway

	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Soviet ships and planes circled in the Arctic twilight Friday at the site where a nuclear submarine was believed to have sunk, and Norway's defense minister said there was reason to believe crew members had been rescued.

	Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst made the comment on Norwegian Radio. He did not elaborate.

	The West German government radio also quoted Holst as saying pilots of reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site. He was quoted as saying he believed the submarine broke in two as it sank and that the Soviets turned down Norwegian offers of help.

	U.S. officials said there "definitely" were casualties aboard, but declined to estimate how many.


why did Holst say different things to different radio stations


recon plane, boats with rubber dinghies with people in them, "it was not clear whether the people were from the submarine or the surface vessels."

	
	..."With the observations we have made with the Soviet vessels and planes in the area, it seems the Soviets can handle this case alone," Holst said on Norwegian radio.


goes on about area, facts about "Mike," quotes expert Johan Baarli saying radiation probably won't be big problem


article is by Doug Mellgren, this printing in Muncie Evening Press has more info:

https://www.newspapers.com/image/250949056/?terms=soviet%2Bsubmarine

	...Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent messages to the prime ministers of Norway and Britain saying that an undetermined number of sailors died in the accident Friday and that the nuclear reactors on the submarine had been shut down before the vessel sank, officials and news reports said.

	...Vadime Rosanov, the Soviet press attache in Oslo, told Norwegian television the sub was carrying torpedoes, not ballistic missiles. However, he declined to say whether the vessel was equipped with nuclear weapons.

	U.S. and Nowegian military sources, who reported the accident before Soviet officials did, said the fire apparently broke out while the vessel was underwater and that it surfaced before sinking.

	...Tass, which did not identify the submarine, said only that "a fire broke out on board a Soviet nuclear-powered torpedo submarine"

	..."Specialists ruled out the possibility of a radioactive contamination of the environment," Tass said. A duty officer at the Soviet Defense Ministry in Moscow said that he had no information on the accident.


taking a page from Chernobyl reporting?

think for some soviets telling you "the possibility of radioactive contimination has been ruled out" translates to "run"

wonder if this caused people to freak out afterward

	Soviet sub sinking kills 12

	OSLO, Norway (UPI)--A Soviet nuclear-powered attack submarine caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea, killing at least 12 crew members, and Soviet President Mikhail Gorachev said today there was no risk of a radiation leak, officials said.

	In a message to British Prime Minister Margaret Tatcher and relayed through aides early today, Gorbachev assured her that "the assessmet of a risk of an explosion or a leak was negligible," a spokeswoman for Thatcher said.

	"What he really wanted to do was reassure her about the nuclear sub accident. He reported where it had occurred, and there had been loss of life," the spokeswoman said.


word "reassure" next to "nuclear sub accident" usually doesn't reassure people...
