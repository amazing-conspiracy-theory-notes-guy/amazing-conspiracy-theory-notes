	...Which wire service to use? Invariably on breaking stories about plane crashes, earthquakes or other tragedies, the news services do not agree on all the details. As editors we've come to expect it, though it does give us some anxious moments. The differences are understandable: Reporters are interviewing different people - hospital officials, police agencies, administrators - and of-ten their numbers don't add up. Most differences can be resolved simply by analyzing the story itself.

	One that leaps to mind involves last spring's Soviet submarine that surfaced off Norway with nuclear reactor trouble. Reading the three services it was easy to tell who had the best vantage: UPI was writing its story from Washington, based on Pentagon reports. AP was collecting information from its bureaus in London and Moscow. Reuters had a reporter/photographer aboard a rescue helicopter hovering overhead. We used Reuters.

	Other calls aren't so easy. Sometimes it requires a query to the local bureau, or, rarely, a call to the general news desks in New York.

	...The sources declined to say when or how the United States first became aware of the submarine's problems, but said it now appeared that Soviet ships and aircraft were being dispatched to the scene.

	The sources said the submarine climbed to the surface in a portion of the Norwegian Sea north of Norway. But the officials declined to say how far off the coastline the submarine was.

	The officials also said it remained unclear as to whether the crew was close to controlling the fires on board or whether the vessel was in any danger of sinking.

	"We don't know what caused the problem, but we think it's their only Mike and we know they've got some fires on board in the Norwegian Sea," one source said.

	"We also have reason to believe there have been some casualties."
