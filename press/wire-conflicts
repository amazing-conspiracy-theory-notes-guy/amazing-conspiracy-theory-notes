	...Which wire service to use? Invariably on breaking stories about plane crashes, earthquakes or other tragedies, the news services do not agree on all the details. As editors we've come to expect it, though it does give us some anxious moments. The differences are understandable: Reporters are interviewing different people - hospital officials, police agencies, administrators - and of-ten their numbers don't add up. Most differences can be resolved simply by analyzing the story itself.

	One that leaps to mind involves last spring's Soviet submarine that surfaced off Norway with nuclear reactor trouble. Reading the three services it was easy to tell who had the best vantage: UPI was writing its story from Washington, based on Pentagon reports. AP was collecting information from its bureaus in London and Moscow. Reuters had a reporter/photographer aboard a rescue helicopter hovering overhead. We used Reuters.

	Other calls aren't so easy. Sometimes it requires a query to the local bureau, or, rarely, a call to the general news desks in New York.

	Soviet Submarine Sinks off Norway

	Nuclear-Driven Craft Goes Down After Fire; 'Major Loss of Life' Reported

	By JOHN M. BRODER and MELISSA HEALY, Times Staff Writers

advanced sub caught fire, sunk, quote U.S. official "major loss of life"

	...At the Soviet Embassy in Oslo, a spokesman early today said the submarine sank but gave no other information, Reuters news agency reported, quoting the Norweigian news agency NTB.

	...Believed One of a Kind

	The accident involving the submarine, believed to be the only one of its kind, may provide an intelligence bonanza for the United States and its allies if reconnaisance ships, aircraft, or satellites were able to take detailed, close-up photographs of the rare craft as it surfaced.

	The Norwegian Defense Minister said that Soviet ships and aircraft were in the area where the sub was lost, in international waters off Spitsbergen Island near the Arctic Circle.

	The statement said Norwegian military aircraft had flown over the area, about 300 miles from North Cape on the Norwegian mainland, and had seen the submarine ablaze. Officials said the fire appeared to be concentrated in the stern, or rear, of the vessel, where water distillation equipment and propulsion machinery are housed.


believed one of a kind, "intelligence bonanza" if U.S. and allies got pictures as it surfaced, Norwegian defence minister statement said Norwegian military aircraft flew over area and observed, Norwegian officials reported where fire located on craft

	
	..."We have observed bodies," Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst told NTB. "We do not yet have an exact figure."

	In an interview broadcast on Britain's Independent Televsion News, Norwegian Defense Ministry spokesman COl. Gullow Gjeseth said that in a flight over the submarine, "I saw at the time two dinghies, with the personnell in one dinghy. We saw also a Soviet merchant ship in the area and we know also Soviet aircraft have been over the area."


norwegian defense personnel saw bodies, dunno how many, saw dinghies, saw Soviet merchant ship and aircraft, and told this to press

on tech of sub, designed for "cat and mouse game". "Special design," "unique propulsian system," double-hulled titanium, carry up to 6 nuke torpedoes


	...White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials had little information on the incident Friday night.

	"There are indications there was a major fire aboard, but we have no details. We understand there has been a loss of life but we can't confirm how many," Fitzwater said. "We express the sympathy of the United States government to the Soviet government for any loss of life involved." President Bush had been notified of the accident, Fitzwater said.

	The area of the sinking in the Norwegian Sea is the site of many naval exercises by both Eastern and Western forces and is considered a potential battleground in the event of a large-scale conflict. Western forces practice keeping Soviet submarines away from Atlantic shipping lanes, while Soviet vessels patrol there to keep track of Western ships.

	One analyst said that before sinking, the submarine could have released its ballast, causing the ship to pop up high on the surface of the ocean, exposing some of the sub's underside.

	"This really could be an intelligence coup," said one American naval analyst. When a disabled Soviet Victor-class submarine surfaced off Newport, R.I., in the mid-1980's, analysts reaped a harvest of valuable intelligence.

	But the accident poses potentialy severe environment hazards as well. Previous submarine accidents have resulted in release of radiation, and in 1961 members of a Soviet submarine crew died of radiation poisoning after an accident in the Baltic, according to recently declassified CIA documents.


makes it sound like CIA did it to get intelligence

	Nuclear-powred Soviet sub apparently sinks near Norway

	By NORMAN BLACK
	Associated Press

	WASHINGTON -- A nuclear-powered Soviet submarine appears to have sunk more than 300 miles off the coast of Norway after suffering an underwater accident and catching fire, U.S. and Norwegian officials said yesterday.

	U.S. officials said there "definitely" were casualties on board the submarine, but they declined to estimate how many.

	They said that the submarine managed to surface for a time after the accident in the Norwegian Sea, and that at least one Soviet ship had responded to a distress call and arrived on the scene.

	"It was on the surface, but now it appears it's gone," one official said on condition of anonymity. "We're trying to get confirmation, but we believe it sank."


quoting a bunch of anonymous officials who won't even say for sure it sank

"it was on the surface, but now it appears it's gone"

goes on to quote Fitzwater sympathy for "any loss of life involved"


one U.S. source gives last known location

another says dunno what caused it

quotes "nuclear specialist" saying reactor "inherently very dangerous"


	...Col. Gollow Gjeseth, press spokesman of Norway's Subpreme Defense Command, said in a telephne interview that a Norwegian observation plane sent over the area saw "a Soviet ship and two rubber boats."

	...The agency said people had been sighted in at least one of the rubber boats, but it was not clear if the boats were from the submarine or from one of the surface vessels.


not meantioning saw bodies as in LA times article? WH spokesman and officials quotes strange given this, "sorry for any loss of life involved"

us sources say no U.S. ships in area or request from Soviets for assistance

goes over "Mike class", unique, some prior Soviet sub accidents

	
	...Jan Bremer, author of the recently published book "Soviet Submarines," says the high accident rate can be traced to poor construction and design, poor maintenance mthods and insufficient training.


goes on about crew training

	
	...Another factor is the dangerous liquid fuel the Soviets use to power their submarine-based missiles. U.S. missile submarines use solid-fuel rockets.


implying the fuel was source of fire?

something similar came up with U.S. vs NK missile program, some journalists writing as if U.S. blowing up rockets and fuel mentioned iirc

	
	Evidence of poor submarine construction on Soviet submarines was uncovered in 194 when the CIA-operated Glomar Explorer succeeded in raising on section of a sunken Golf II submarine.


trying to rub it in? Glomar Explorer was sore-point to Soviets

	
	"Hull thickness varied widely, and welds were uneven and dangerously pitted," Bremer wrote. "Most surprising was the use of four-by-two wooden beams for internal structural support."

	U.S. Defense Department officials have long asserted that the Russian navy does not attach as much importance to the safety of its nuclear operations as do Western navies.


why write this in article on Soviet sailors who just died?

quotes Arikin again "inherently very dangerous", ends with if reactor "could be quite catastrophic."

	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Soviet ships and planes circled in the Arctic twilight Friday at the site where a nuclear submarine was believed to have sunk, and Norway's defense minister said there was reason to believe crew members had been rescued.

	Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst made the comment on Norwegian Radio. He did not elaborate.

	The West German government radio also quoted Holst as saying pilots of reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site. He was quoted as saying he believed the submarine broke in two as it sank and that the Soviets turned down Norwegian offers of help.

	...Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent messages to the prime ministers of Norway and Britain saying that an undetermined number of sailors died in the accident Friday and that the nuclear reactors on the submarine had been shut down before the vessel sank, officials and news reports said.

	...Vadime Rosanov, the Soviet press attache in Oslo, told Norwegian television the sub was carrying torpedoes, not ballistic missiles. However, he declined to say whether the vessel was equipped with nuclear weapons.

	U.S. and Nowegian military sources, who reported the accident before Soviet officials did, said the fire apparently broke out while the vessel was underwater and that it surfaced before sinking.

	...Tass, which did not identify the submarine, said only that "a fire broke out on board a Soviet nuclear-powered torpedo submarine"

	..."Specialists ruled out the possibility of a radioactive contamination of the environment," Tass said. A duty officer at the Soviet Defense Ministry in Moscow said that he had no information on the accident.


taking a page from Chernobyl reporting?

think for some soviets telling you "the possibility of radioactive contimination has been ruled out" translates to "run"

wonder if this caused people to freak out afterward

	60 feared dead in fire, sinking of Soviet sub

	Reuters

	OSLO, Norway -- At least 60 Soviet sailors are feared dead after their nuclear-powered submarine caught fire, exploded and sank in the Arctic, Norwegian television reported on Saturday.

	It quoted Norway's Defense Ministry for the death toll more than 23 hours after the submarine went down about 100 miles south of Bear Island deep inside the Arctic Circle.

	"There is much to indicate that the number of dead was higher than first thought, although we do not have an exact figure, Defense Ministry spokesman Erik Senstad said."

	Earlier Western estimates put the number of known dead at 12 and about 50 missing.


earlier reports quoted the official on ABC news and said "12 reported dead", some reports said "Holst said the crew was rescued"


	...Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said the submarine's nuclear reactor was shut down before it sank.

	The submarine would normally carry a crew of 95 and a Nowegian Defense Ministry statement said it seemed that between 40 and 50 crew members appeared to have escaped before it sank in 5,000 feet of water.

	"How many of those survived injuries and exposure to the cold water is uncertain," the statement said.

	The ministry said a Norwegian air force observation plane had spotted the men clinging to rafts.

why couldn't officials interviewed by AP just say that?

apparently all they told AP was "we're trying to get confirmation" if it sunk, were "definitely" casualties

	No Sub Radiation Peril, Soviets Say

	Gorbachev Reassures World Leaders; More than 60 Feared Lost in Sinking

	By WILLIAM TUOHY and MICHAEL PARKS, Times Staff Writers

	OSLO--Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sought to assure the world Saturday that no Chernobyl-like disaster looms in Arctic waters and observers here said the fiery accident that sank an advanced nuclear-powered submarine Friday claimed many more lives than initially believed.

	After battling fire, explosion and the icy Norwegian Sea, more than 60 Soviet submariners are now feared dead as a result of the catastrophe that touched off international concerns of radioactive dangers.

	"There is much to indicate that the number of dead was higher than first thought--though we do not have an exact figure," Norway's Defense Ministry spokesman Erik Senstad said. Earlier reports placed the number of deaths at 12, with many missing and an un-

LA Times combines stories, adds to radiation fears and takes it further by hinting that submariner deaths could have been from radiation


	Gorbachev relayed statements to the President Bush and other world leaders offering assurances that no nuclear disaster is in store in Arctic waters--in part because the crew shut off the submarine's nuclear reactors before abandoning the vessel.


How about this for headline: Soviet submariners heroes, 60 die as shut off nuclear reactors before sinking ?

LA Times and other sources put this words of Gorbachev and left at that, which would probably make readers of Western newspapers suspicious instead of "assured," especially after Chernobyl

think the authors know that...


	"The possibility of a nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is excluded, according to the opinion of experts," Gorbachev said in one such telegram to the NOrwegian government.

	Nevertheless, Norway dispatched ships and helicopters to collect water and air samples to be tested in Oslo for possible radioactvity.

	Norwegian scientists reported early today that preliminary tests indicated little chance of radioactive contamination of the air.

	...U.S. authorities said the possibility of widespread contamination is slight.

	...If Norway's statements prove correction, about two-thirds of the submarine's 95-member crew were killed in the drama that began when a fire broke out abaout 11:41 a.m., local time

	...According to some unofficial reports in the Soviet Union, the crew may have scuttled the vessel themselves after battling the fire for more than five hours.

	Later, some crew members were spotted by Norwegian air force observers in overloaded life rafts. Some men were clinging to the sides, immersied in the icy waters. Norwegian television showed a photograph of a raft, packed with crew members.

	1st test finds no leak of radiation from sub

	By Thom Shanker

	Chicago Tribune

	WASHINGTON--Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev assured the governments of the United States and Norway Saturday that the nuclear-powered submarine that caught fire and sank in Arctic waters poses no threat of radioactive pollution.

	And initial tests of water samples taken by the Norwegian navy in the area of the accident showed no sign of radiation leaks, according to Norwegian officials, who also said about 50 sailors are believed to have died in the accident.

	Gorbacheve asserted in a message to Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, "according to the opinion of experts, the possiiblity of a nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is excluded."

	Similar assurance were passed along to President Bush By Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, the White House said.

	Soviets say sub won't leak radiation; 60 reported dead

	By Erland Lyngve
	United Press International

	OSLO, Norway--The Soviet Union has assured Western leaders there is no danger of a radiation leak from a nuclear-powered submarine that caught fire and sank in an accident Norway estimates killed about 60 sailors.

	The Norwegian Defense Command said 40 or 50 of the crew members on the advanced attack submarine escaped after the vessel caught fire Friday on the Norwegian Sea, but some died later of their injuries.

	The statement said the estimate of 60 deaths was based on airborne observations of the rescue effort at the site about 300 miles off the Norwegian coast.

	Norwegian ships and aircraft were ordered to test water and air for radiation, despite Soviet assurances the titanium-hulled, Mike-class sub's nuclear reactor had been turned off and that there was no danger of contamination.

	"We know for sure that the nuclear reactor is shut down," Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov was quoted as saying by the Soviet newspaper Izvestia. "In the opinion of competent services, a radioactive contamination of the environment is ruled out."

	...Despite the assurances, Norwegian officials requested all Norwegian ships in the area to take water samples, and aircraft were to be sent over the area to measures for radiation in the air, officials said Saturday.

	A Norwegian radiation specialist said the likelihood of radiation escaping from the vessel was minimal.

	...Soviet officials confirmed there were deaths in the accident, but gave no details.

	A reporter for the Soviet military newspaper Red Star said the submarine's crew scuttled the craft and it sank a mile to the ocean floor after a fruitless five-hour battle to extinguish the fire Friday.

	"The water out there was cold, the sea choppy and it was windy," the journalist said in a telephone interview. "The fire broke out when the sub was returning from a long mission. The crew tried for five hours to extinguish the flames but to no avail."

	"There should be no danger of radioactivity because the crew shut down the reactor and the sank the sub themselves."

	The Red Star journalist said he did not know whether the captain of the submarine, who he identified as Yevgeny Vanin, survived.

	Moscow Confirms Blaze and Deaths Aboard Lost Nuclear Sub

	By FRANCIS X. CLINES

	Special to The New York Times

	MOSCOW, APril 8--The Soviet Government today confirmed the fire and fatalities aboard a nuclear-powered submarine that sank at sea Friday, but insisted that there was no danger of nuclear contamination of the environment.

	"We know for sure that the nuclear reactor is shut down," the Defense Minister, Dmitri T. Yazov said in an interview in the Government newspaper Izvestia. "In the opinion of competent sources, a radioactive contamination of the environment is ruled out."

	The submarine, said by American and Norwegian specialists to be armed with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, disappeared in the Norwegian Sea in international waters 270 miles north of Norway's northern cape.

	Soviet officials did not say how many of the 95 crew members died, but Western officials who monitored Soviet naval radio report the death toll may have been 11 or 12.



how did the fact that 60 sailors died in a world-wide publicized accident not make it to the New York Times?


...


from reports so far:


experimental sub on fire, might have nuclear weapons on board

surfaces, fight fire for hours

some crewmen in dinghies

Norwegian aircraft fly overhead

eventually, crew (maybe) decides to scuttle ship after shutting down reactor

soviet ships take some time to get there, see some crew in frigid water

western news sources are reporting at first 12 dead

next day, turns out 60 dead, but news inexplicably shifting focus to radiation fears, putting figures burried in article, couhing in "soviets won't tell us," or in NY Times case not reporting at all


but it's weird so many died--the Norwegian aircraft were right there, already got pictures of craft, Soviets wouldn't care if got close enough to rescue, yet Noreweigan gov says Soviets refused rescue

Soviet ships take time to get there, meanwhile some report shipped scuttled when they could have waited on sub for rescue ships instead of in frigid water, where many were reported to have died or died from later

the press ended up downplaying a story not only important, hurts U.S-Soviet relations to dismiss, but perplexing, suggesting something more going on here


what happened on the submarine? how did crewmen die?
