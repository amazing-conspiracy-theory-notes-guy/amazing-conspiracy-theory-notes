https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_IX

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Melfi

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Civitate#Aftermath
	After preparing a siege of the town of Civitate itself, the Pope was taken prisoner by the victorious Normans.

	There is some uncertainty over how this happened. Papal sources say that Leo left Civitate and surrendered himself to prevent further bloodshed.[citation needed] Other sources including Malaterra indicate that the inhabitants of Civitate handed over the Pope and drove him "out of the gates," after seeing the Norman threat manifested in siege towers and earthen ramparts.[14] He was treated respectfully but was imprisoned at Benevento for almost nine months, and forced to ratify a number of treaties favorable to the Normans. However, according to the Norman accounts, Leo was treated more as an honored guest than as a prisoner, and by no means lacked for comforts, Amatus claims that "they continually furnished him with wine, bread, and all the necessities," and was "protected" by the Normans until he returned to Rome ten months later.[15] According to John Julius Norwich, Leo attempted a long, passive resistance to agreeing to anything for the Normans, and was waiting for an imperial relief army from Germany. In addition, Norwich believes that despite the lack of concrete support until later popes, Leo did eventually acknowledge the Normans as the rulers of the South in order to get a release for his freedom.[16] Meanwhile, Argyros and the Byzantine army were forced to disband and return to Greece via Bari, since their forces were not strong enough to fight the Normans now that the papal forces had been defeated. Argyros may even have been banished from the Empire by Constantine himself.[17]


what was going on here? remember another wikipedia source saying the normans still liked the pope are were acting all reverent to him even after capturing him

looks like this might be a good book

https://archive.org/stream/pressandsociety030075mbp/pressandsociety030075mbp_djvu.txt
	In preparing the revised edition of this book, the editors have 
	found that the period of World War II produced relatively little re- 
	search devoted to the press. Since that period excellent studies have 
	been published with increasing frequency, however, and upon these 
	latter years the editors have drawn heavily. 

	The primary purpose of the editors has been to preserve the his- 
	torical depth of the book, so that young students may learn what 
	critics of the press formerly held to be true. These students may de- 
	cide from their own experience and from the writings of present-day 
	critics whether the old opinions are still tenable. A few statements 
	about the press have become landmarks of scholarly reference. These 
	have been retained. Citations that relied heavily upon statistics of 
	the day have been replaced in order to give a truer postwar picture.

http://historiarex.com/e/en/376-cortes-pizarro
	He landed on the Yucatan Peninsula in March, and by a stroke of good fortune, came upon a Franciscan friar named Geronimo de Aguilar.  De Aguilar had survived a shipwreck, but had been captured by the local Mayans.  He escaped, but not before learning their language.  Thus he was able to serve as Cortés' interpreter. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger%C3%B3nimo_de_Aguilar
	Aguilar and 11-12 other survivors[2] were captured by the local Maya and scheduled to be sacrificed to Maya gods. Valdivia and four others met this fate. Others died of disease and, in the case of the women, overwork as slaves. Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero (a sailor from Palos de la Frontera in Spain) managed to escape, later to be taken as slaves by another Mayan chief named Xamanzana who was hostile to the first tribe.[3] Here he and Guerrero were able to learn the language of their captors. Aguilar lived as a slave during his eight years with the Maya. His continued fidelity to his religious vows led him to refuse the offers of women made to him by the chief. Guerrero became a war chief for Nachan Kaan, Lord of Chektumal, married a rich Maya woman and fathered the first mestizo children of Mexico.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Guerrero
	Bernal Díaz de Castillo (Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España, Chapter XXIX) records Aguilar's account, whereby Mayans sacrificed some of the ship's crew almost immediately, while putting the rest into cages. The Europeans managed to escape, but other Mayan lords captured and enslaved them. By 1519, the year Hernán Cortés began his Conquest of Mexico, only two from the original shipwreck remained alive: Gonzalo Guerrero, who by this time had become famous in the Mayan world as a war leader for Nachan Can, Lord of Chactemal (which included parts of Mexico and Belize); and Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had taken holy orders in his native Spain. Guerrero had by then married Nachan Can's daughter Zazil Há and had fathered the first mestizo children in the region. Cortes also learned that it was Guerrero's suggestion which led to the earlier attack on Cordoba's expedition.[2]:60–65


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Hern%C3%A1ndez_de_C%C3%B3rdoba_(Yucat%C3%A1n_conquistador)
	Little is known of Córdoba's life before his exploration of the Yucatán. A native of Spain, he was living in Cuba in 1517, indicating that he had participated in the conquest of the island. He was also quite wealthy, as he both owned a landed estate, including a native town, and financed his expedition to Mexico.

	...From Bernal Díaz del Castillo's narrative, it appears possible to deduce — possibly against the narrator's own pretences because he would prefer to keep this hidden — that the original goal of the project was to capture Indians as slaves to increase or replace the manpower available to work the agricultural land or the mines of Cuba, and so that the Spaniards resident on the island who did not have Indians for their own exploitation of the land, such as Bernal himself, could establish themselves as hacendados.

https://books.google.com/books?id=DkgGVTOr2EsC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40
	...Although their men are released, de las Casas and Gonzalez Davila are held prisoner in Olid's household at Naco. Eventually, they stab Olid one night in bed, and although he flees, de las Casas persuades the soldiery to overtake him the next day and slit his throat.


is this *that* de las Casas?

something going on with Las Casas, the murder of Olid and Gonzales Davila:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Gonz%C3%A1lez_D%C3%A1vila

Davila was first conquistador to make contact with Nicaraguans, fought with de Soto and deo Cordoba, teamed up with Las Casas and ended up getting arrested and threatened with execution for murder of Olid


Las Casas dissed the guy who wrote chronicles of Davila's explorations too:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Oviedo_y_Vald%C3%A9s
	The Historia, though written in a diffuse style, furnishes a mass of information collected at first hand. Las Casas, the fellow contemporary chronicler of the Spanish colonization of the Caribbean, denounced Oviedo and the Historia thus: "one of the greatest tyrants, thieves, and destroyers of the Indies, whose Historia contains almost as many lies as pages".[3] The incomplete Seville edition was widely read in the English and French versions published by Eden and Poleur, respectively, in 1555 and 1556.[1]


https://thebiography.us/en/gonzalez-davila-gil1
	González Dávila returned to Spain in 1515 and 1518 befriended the pilot Andrés Niño - son of the pilot of the same name, according to Las Casas, or the famous pilot, according to Fernández de Oviedo- who was aware of what happened in Panama after the execution of Balboa.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_the_Cakchiquels
	The Annals of the Cakchiquels (in Spanish: Anales de los Cakchiqueles, also known by the alternative Spanish titles, Anales de los Xahil, Memorial de Tecpán-Atitlán or Memorial de Sololá) is a manuscript written in Kaqchikel by Francisco Hernández Arana Xajilá in 1571, and completed by his grandson, Francisco Rojas, in 1604.[1][2] The manuscript — which describes the legends of the Kaqchikel nation and has historical and mythological components — is considered an important historical document on post-classic Maya civilization in the highlands of Guatemala.


how come these guys could write but Inca and other civs couldn't?



they did have this: https://www.ancient.eu/Quipu/


it's like writing but a computer code in strings


	...Many Inca quipu were purposely destroyed when Atawalpa took power and sought to clean the slate of Inca history, and, in particular, destroy the historical record concerning the reign of his bitter rival and half-brother, Waskhar. Then, following the Spanish conquest, even more quipu records were sought out and destroyed, the new rulers being highly suspicious of the information they might contain within their knots. As a result of these actions, only several hundred examples of quipu survive today. However, quipu are still used by Andean people even today, most often by shepherds and herders as a method to record livestock numbers.


what's up with that?

	The total population at that time was once estimated to be a few million, said Diane Davies, an archaeologist and Maya specialist based in the United Kingdom. But in light of the new lidar data, she said it could now be closer to 10 million.

	...“I don’t think you see a lot of discoveries happening across the sciences right now that sort of turn a discipline on its head,” he said. “It’s exciting to know that it can still happen.”


how did 10 million people dissappear?
