https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Melfi

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Civitate#Aftermath
	After preparing a siege of the town of Civitate itself, the Pope was taken prisoner by the victorious Normans.

	There is some uncertainty over how this happened. Papal sources say that Leo left Civitate and surrendered himself to prevent further bloodshed.[citation needed] Other sources including Malaterra indicate that the inhabitants of Civitate handed over the Pope and drove him "out of the gates," after seeing the Norman threat manifested in siege towers and earthen ramparts.[14] He was treated respectfully but was imprisoned at Benevento for almost nine months, and forced to ratify a number of treaties favorable to the Normans. However, according to the Norman accounts, Leo was treated more as an honored guest than as a prisoner, and by no means lacked for comforts, Amatus claims that "they continually furnished him with wine, bread, and all the necessities," and was "protected" by the Normans until he returned to Rome ten months later.[15] According to John Julius Norwich, Leo attempted a long, passive resistance to agreeing to anything for the Normans, and was waiting for an imperial relief army from Germany. In addition, Norwich believes that despite the lack of concrete support until later popes, Leo did eventually acknowledge the Normans as the rulers of the South in order to get a release for his freedom.[16] Meanwhile, Argyros and the Byzantine army were forced to disband and return to Greece via Bari, since their forces were not strong enough to fight the Normans now that the papal forces had been defeated. Argyros may even have been banished from the Empire by Constantine himself.[17]

	In preparing the revised edition of this book, the editors have 
	found that the period of World War II produced relatively little re- 
	search devoted to the press. Since that period excellent studies have 
	been published with increasing frequency, however, and upon these 
	latter years the editors have drawn heavily. 

	The primary purpose of the editors has been to preserve the his-

	critics of the press formerly held to be true. These students may de- 
	cide from their own experience and from the writings of present-day 
	critics whether the old opinions are still tenable. A few statements 
	about the press have become landmarks of scholarly reference. These 
	have been retained. Citations that relied heavily upon statistics of

http://historiarex.com/e/en/376-cortes-pizarro
	He landed on the Yucatan Peninsula in March, and by a stroke of good fortune, came upon a Franciscan friar named Geronimo de Aguilar.  De Aguilar had survived a shipwreck, but had been captured by the local Mayans.  He escaped, but not before learning their language.  Thus he was able to serve as Cortés' interpreter. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger%C3%B3nimo_de_Aguilar
	Aguilar and 11-12 other survivors[2] were captured by the local Maya and scheduled to be sacrificed to Maya gods. Valdivia and four others met this fate. Others died of disease and, in the case of the women, overwork as slaves. Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero (a sailor from Palos de la Frontera in Spain) managed to escape, later to be taken as slaves by another Mayan chief named Xamanzana who was hostile to the first tribe.[3] Here he and Guerrero were able to learn the language of their captors. Aguilar lived as a slave during his eight years with the Maya. His continued fidelity to his religious vows led him to refuse the offers of women made to him by the chief. Guerrero became a war chief for Nachan Kaan, Lord of Chektumal, married a rich Maya woman and fathered the first mestizo children of Mexico.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Guerrero
	Bernal Díaz de Castillo (Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España, Chapter XXIX) records Aguilar's account, whereby Mayans sacrificed some of the ship's crew almost immediately, while putting the rest into cages. The Europeans managed to escape, but other Mayan lords captured and enslaved them. By 1519, the year Hernán Cortés began his Conquest of Mexico, only two from the original shipwreck remained alive: Gonzalo Guerrero, who by this time had become famous in the Mayan world as a war leader for Nachan Can, Lord of Chactemal (which included parts of Mexico and Belize); and Gerónimo de Aguilar, who had taken holy orders in his native Spain. Guerrero had by then married Nachan Can's daughter Zazil Há and had fathered the first mestizo children in the region. Cortes also learned that it was Guerrero's suggestion which led to the earlier attack on Cordoba's expedition.[2]:60–65


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Hern%C3%A1ndez_de_C%C3%B3rdoba_(Yucat%C3%A1n_conquistador)
	Little is known of Córdoba's life before his exploration of the Yucatán. A native of Spain, he was living in Cuba in 1517, indicating that he had participated in the conquest of the island. He was also quite wealthy, as he both owned a landed estate, including a native town, and financed his expedition to Mexico.

	...From Bernal Díaz del Castillo's narrative, it appears possible to deduce — possibly against the narrator's own pretences because he would prefer to keep this hidden — that the original goal of the project was to capture Indians as slaves to increase or replace the manpower available to work the agricultural land or the mines of Cuba, and so that the Spaniards resident on the island who did not have Indians for their own exploitation of the land, such as Bernal himself, could establish themselves as hacendados.

Las Casas dissed the guy who wrote chronicles of Davila's explorations too:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Oviedo_y_Vald%C3%A9s
	The Historia, though written in a diffuse style, furnishes a mass of information collected at first hand. Las Casas, the fellow contemporary chronicler of the Spanish colonization of the Caribbean, denounced Oviedo and the Historia thus: "one of the greatest tyrants, thieves, and destroyers of the Indies, whose Historia contains almost as many lies as pages".[3] The incomplete Seville edition was widely read in the English and French versions published by Eden and Poleur, respectively, in 1555 and 1556.[1]


https://thebiography.us/en/gonzalez-davila-gil1
	González Dávila returned to Spain in 1515 and 1518 befriended the pilot Andrés Niño - son of the pilot of the same name, according to Las Casas, or the famous pilot, according to Fernández de Oviedo- who was aware of what happened in Panama after the execution of Balboa.

	...Many Inca quipu were purposely destroyed when Atawalpa took power and sought to clean the slate of Inca history, and, in particular, destroy the historical record concerning the reign of his bitter rival and half-brother, Waskhar. Then, following the Spanish conquest, even more quipu records were sought out and destroyed, the new rulers being highly suspicious of the information they might contain within their knots. As a result of these actions, only several hundred examples of quipu survive today. However, quipu are still used by Andean people even today, most often by shepherds and herders as a method to record livestock numbers.

	The Spanish Crown's policy toward the enslavement of the indigenous peoples was ambiguous. When Pope Alexander VI gave Spain the right to colonize the New World in 1493 he stated that the Spanish should convert the indigenous peoples to Christianity and he prohibited their enslavement. At the same time he stated that if the indigenous peoples refused to convert to Christianity or once convverted they reverted back to their old religious practices they could be enslaved. This ambiguity allowed the power-seeking Spanish conquistadors to enslave hundreds of thousands of indigenous peoples via the encomienda system that had originally been use by the Spanish against the Moors (Muslims). The Crown gave the conquistadors some of the land that they conquered including its inhabitants, and this was referred to as encomienda.


if they couldn't understand the language, and would get enslaved if they didn't convert, isn't this a license to enslave everyone?

http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/05/traces-some-south-america-s-earliest-people-found-under-ancient-dirt-pyramid
	The evidence of early human occupation stunned Tom Dillehay, an archaeologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who led the new study. Initially, he was interested in examining the mound itself. But geologists on his team wanted to study the landform under the mound, so “we just kept going down,” he says. The deepest pit, which took 5 years to excavate, reached down 31 meters. Shockingly, those deep layers contained telltale signs of human occupation, Dillehay’s team reports today in Science Advances: evidence of hearth fires, animal bones, plant remains, and simple but unmistakable stone tools. Radiocarbon dates from charcoal place the earliest human occupation at nearly 15,000 years ago.

	That’s made some researchers say Huaca Prieta should join the small but growing list of pre-14,000-year-old sites that have revolutionized scientists’ vision of the earliest Americans. Archaeologists used to think that people walked from Siberia through an ice-free passage down Alaska and Canada, reaching the interior of the United States about 13,000 years ago. In recent years, however, well documented earlier sites like Chile’s Monte Verde have convinced most archaeologists that humans made it deep into the Americas by 14,500 years ago, meaning that they would have had to cross Canada long before an ice-free corridor existed. That would have left them with one logical route into the Americas: down the Pacific coast. But direct evidence for such a migration is lacking.







https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/05/0528_020528_sunkencities.html
	Cuba's Sunken City

	...Many scientists are skeptical of any theory that might tempt people to draw a parallel with the fabled lost city of Atlantis. Geologist Manuel Iturralde, however, has stressed the need for an open mind while investigations of the site continue.

	"These are extremely peculiar structures, and they have captured our imagination," said Iturralde, who is director of research at Cuba's Natural History Museum. Iturralde has studied countless underwater formations over the years, but said, "If I had to explain this geologically, I would have a hard time."

	In his report on the formations, Iturralde noted that conclusive proof of man-made structures on the site could reinforce some oral traditions of the Maya and native Yucatecos. These people still retell ancient stories of an island inhabited by their ancestors that vanished beneath the waves. 


http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160118-the-atlantis-style-myths-of-sunken-lands-that-are-really-true
	The Atlantis-style myths that turned out to be true

	In one cataclysmic night, the gods sent a battalion of fire and earthquakes so intense that the Utopian kingdom of Atlantis sank deep into the ocean, never to be found again.

	So tells Plato's infamous myth, which has captivated audiences for more than 2,300 years. Many people have subsequently floated theories about exactly where Atlantis was: in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Spain, even under Antarctica. A popular idea is that the Atlantis myth is associated with the fate of Thera, now the Greek island of Santorini, which was partly destroyed by a volcanic eruption about 3,600 years ago. But many, if not most, scientists think we will never tie Atlantis to a real location.

	"I don't think there's any question that the story of Atlantis is a myth," says Patrick Nunn, a geologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia.

	But Atlantis is not the only legend of a sunken city. Similar tales are told around the world, and it now seems that some of them are true.

	...Plato was living in a volcanically and tectonically active part of the world where massive earthquakes and tsunamis were not usual.

	"He observed what was going on and he used details from these observations to make his narrative about Atlantis sound more credible," says Nunn. "But, I think, there's no way that we could consider Atlantis as a particular place."

	Despite Nunn's scepticism about this ill-fated kingdom, he is one of a growing band of geologists who have begun to take an interest in similar myths in the belief that some really can shed light on ancient geological events.

	In 1966, the scientist Dorothy Vitaliano coined a name for the discipline: geomythology. It is, she said, the science of "seeking to find the real geological event underlying a myth or legend to which it has given rise".

	...A close inspection of such "geomyths" has revealed valuable information – a date for the most recent eruption of the volcano Nabukelevu in Fiji, for example.

	When Nunn heard the story of another lost island, Teonimanu in the Solomon Islands of the South Pacific, he was instantly intrigued. "It was high land, it wasn't a low atoll or reef island just made of sand that could be easily washed away," Nunn says. "It was a substantial island that disappeared."

	The tale tells of the cuckolded husband Roraimenu, whose wife Sauwete'au went to live with another man on the island of Teonimanu. An enraged Roraimenu purchased a wave curse to seek his revenge and travelled to the island of Teonimanu, with four waves attached to the front of his canoe, and four on the rear.

	Once ashore, he planted two taro plants, kept another and beat a hasty retreat to his own island of Ali'ite. The curse stated that when the leaves sprouted on his taro plant, the onslaught would start. On that day, Roraimenu watched from a mountaintop as the eight waves surged on Teonimanu, one by one, until it sank, never to be seen again.

	Nunn interprets the waves in the story as a description of a tsunami train – many tsunamis consist of a series of waves. "But of course, waves can't wash away islands, particularly islands that are high and volcanic," Nunn says.

	It was actually a sea-floor earthquake that geologists believe took the island, which had always teetered on the edge of a steep, undersea slope. Once the tremors shook the foundations, a large landslide carried Teonimanu underwater, which likely generated a tsunami train in the process.

	For the people that survived, and lived to tell, and retell, the tale, the waves and the island's destruction are inextricably linked. "So you actually get the island subsiding, or sinking, abruptly at the same time as the waves are generated," Nunn says.

	...What's more, surveys conducted of the sea floor in the region have revealed submerged debris that could be evidence of the loss of a number of islands, with older islands further down the slope. "This made it clear to me that entire islands could disappear," Nunn says.

	...No less dramatic are ancient stories of coastal cities being lost to the waves. Several are described in ancient Sanskrit texts, including the Mahabharata, a 4000-year-old poem that has the honour of being the longest epic narrative in world literature. The Mahabharata and another Sanskrit epic – the Ramayana – were originally written on palm leaves.

	A tale in the Mahabharata tells how Lord Krishna, following a battle victory, decided to leave the city of Dwaraka for his heavenly abode. The Arabian Sea then submerged it. Although long believed to be no more than a mythical kingdom, a 1963 archaeological investigation discovered Dwaraka intact, under the sea, on India's Saurashtra coast.

	Similar stories exist about the city of Poompuhar and ancient ruins at the city of Mahabalipuram. Both are also now known also to have existed: the Mahabalipuram ruins "reappeared" after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. "When you look at these places, they're all saying the same thing," Nunn says. "That large waves came on land and washed away the places that people were living in."

	But Nunn believes that tsunamis alone don't account for the submergence and subsequent abandonment of such cities.

	Instead he believes that the steady creep of post-glacial sea level rise slowly claimed the coastal lands and the tsunamis merely finished off the job.

	...But tales about these less glamorous, tortoise-paced inundations are few and far between. "We humans like disaster stories but adapting to gradual change doesn't sell so well," says Martin Bates, a geoarchaeologist at University of Wales Trinity Saint David.

	That is, unless you are an Aborigine living on the coast of Australia.

	Around 20,000 years ago, at the coldest time of the last ice age, the sea level was about 120 metres below its present level.

	...But as temperatures rose, huge masses of ice started to melt and pour waters into the world's oceans. During the next 13,000 years, sea levels gradually rose to reach their current levels.

	"We think Australia was abuzz with talk about this as it would have been a major concern," says Nicholas Reid, a linguist at the University of New England in Australia.

	...Reid teamed up with Nunn, and between them they searched through documented Aboriginal Australian stories for tales describing times when sea levels were lower than today, or rising. They found 21 such stories from different locations around the Australian coast describing landscapes that had become submerged, never to re-emerge.

	...Others are more figurative. In one such story an ancestral character, Ngurunderi, chased his wives who attempted to flee to Kangaroo Island on foot. In his anger, Ngurunderi summoned the seas to rise, separating the island from the mainland and turning the women into rocks that now jut out of the water.

	By connecting each story with the specific geological event it describes, the researchers believe they could date some of the narratives as between 7,000 and 10,000 years old.

	...Scientists have previously thought that the accuracy of such stories could not persist for much more than 800 years without being written down. But Reid believes a key feature of Indigenous storytelling culture – a "cross-generational cross-checking" process – could explain the stories endurance through the millennia.

	...Perhaps, most importantly of all, myths can provide a form of validation for geological events that simply cannot be confirmed by current scientific methods.

	"As geoscientists, we look back into the past and infer that things happened but we can't prove that they happened," Nunn says. "But if someone says, 'I saw this happen and this is how it happened', that's incredible. It's the best corroboration that you can get."

	Pre-Columbian Earthworks in Coastal Amazonia - MDPI

	Abstract: As in other parts of Amazonia, pre-Columbian Indians have profoundly modified the coast of the Guianas. Between 650 and 1650 AD, Arauquinoid people occupied a territory that was approximately 600 km long and used the raised field technique intensively before the European conquest. They erected thousands of raised fields of various shapes, dug canals, ditches, and pathways, and built artificial mounds to establish their villages. All these earthworks changed forever the face of the coastal flooded savannas and their ecology. Such labor was probably organized under the leadership of a central authority: it seems that Arauquinoid societies were organized in a chiefdom system. Statistical calculations, based on the known surface area of raised fields and on their estimated productivity, suggest a population density of 50 to 100 inhabitants per km 2 . Pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Guianas coast carefully organized, managed and “anthropisized” their territory following a specific pattern.

	1. Introduction

	Until recently, it was inferred that slash-and-burn agriculture was predominant in Amazonia during pre-Columbian times. Today, some archaeologists hypothesize that the first agricultural inhabitants of the rainforest most likely employed more complex techniques [2], which left important and long-lasting modifications in the landscape [3]. Classical techniques were generally used to cultivate most of the forested part of Amazonia. On the other hand, Indians had to develop specific agricultural techniques for flooded areas like the várzea, flooded savannas or swamps. One of them was to build raised fields associated with drainage canals in flooding lowlands. Such earthworks profoundly changed and affected the landscape, to the extent that the legacy of this pre-Columbian land use remains visible today [4].

	1.  Introduction

	The Merin lagoon basin in eastern Uruguay was, from 5000 to 200 BP, the site of one of the largest human landscape modifications in the marginal oceanic areas of the South American plains. Throughout the mid and late Holocene, thousands of mounds were built in well-defined areas, particularly in those that today are swamp or marsh areas. Even mounds that were built at the top of hills are linked to lowlands, because the selected places were located in middle and low plains, or in ‘‘sierras’’ with projections into the plains ( Bracco et al., 2000a ).

	...Radiocarbon dates indicate that mounds were constructed throughout extensive periods, involving in some cases 3000 years. Brazilian researchers of the 1960s and 1970s inferred that mounds were some kind of ‘‘platform’’ built to inhabit flooded areas by groups specialized in the exploitation of such environments ( Naue, 1971, 1973 ; Schmitz, 1973, 1976 ; Cope ` , 1991 , amon gothers). On the other hand, Uruguayan archeologists inferred that they were funerary structures of complex hunter–gatherers, taking into account the recurrence of burials at mounds ( Lo ́ pez and Bracco, 1992, 1994 ; Cabrera, 2000 ; Lo ́ pez, 2001 , amon gothers). This explanation of mound functionality is currently under debate ( Bracco and Ures, 1999 ).


https://books.google.com/books?id=vbmBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223
	...Some important sites, such as Banadero, were, however, excavated with more traditional, and less precise, techniques, such as using 'artifical levels' of 10 cm thickness. ...The same technical influence can be recognized later in the series of excavations carried out by the archaeological rescure unit in the basin of Merin Lagoon. Since 1986 the excavations carried out on mounds (cerritos) in the east of Urugua were archived with the application of the same refined excatation techniques ...As such, interpretations made by researchers in the 1960s (e.g. Schmitz 1976) concluded that the mounds were habitation platforms in flood zones. However, in light of the information from the detailed ethnographic excavation, an alternative model was proposed which was centered on the funerary and cermemonial function of the mounds (Curbelo et al,. 1990; Femenias et al. 1990; Lopez 1992, 1994; Lopez and Bracco 1992, 1994).


https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291771901_Prehistoria_y_Arqueologia_de_la_Cuenca_de_la_Laguna_Merin
	From the middle Holocene, when most of the South American lowlands acquired their current conformation, human groups began to explore these environments. In some cases, this exploration was followed by effective occupation, sometimes reaching, over the course of centuries or millennia, a dramatic alteration of the landscape, expressed through hundreds to thousands of mounds. Beyond the similarity of these environments across the subcontinent, the human responses to the environment with which they interacted appear as similar as they are heterogeneous, accounting for the cultural diversity of the peoples that generated them. In this context, the villages builders of cerritos of Uruguay do not seem to be the exception. These groups occupied the eastern plains for more than 4,000 years, which is in itself a powerful evidence of successful adaptation. However, the reason for alteration of the landscape and the interaction with the environment, according to cultural patterns and particular subsistence strategies, continues to be a matter of debate, of dissimilar interpretations and the engine of future ventures, for the satisfaction of those who pretend let your matter be a living science. It is feasible to manage the product-process reality of our discipline if we agree that Prehistory is the daughter of Archeology. From this perspective and considering the state of art of the Prehistory of eastern Uruguay, we have opted for a presentation structure that observes the historical development of the archeology of the basin, deploying, fundamentally for recent times, an analytical and critical vision . Through this it is not intended to qualify or discredit, but simply to fuel a fruitful debate.


	...The Laguna Merín Basin is located between 31o34o south latitude and 52o 54o west longitude, integrating the east of the plains of the South American middle latitudes. Its extension is 54,000 km 2, of which 24,000 km 2 are developed in Brazilian territory and 30,000 km 2 in Uruguayan territory. The most important geographical feature is the Merín lagoon itself, with a water mirror that ranges between 4000 and 8000 km2, for periods of deficit and excess water, respectively. This huge body of fresh water drains into Laguna de los Patos, which in turn is directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean (figure 1). In Uruguay, the western boundary of the basin is formed by the Serranías del Este, constituting the watershed that separates it from the Río Negro and Santa Lucía systems, to the northwest and west. To the south, the boundary with the oceanic slope is made up of the Cuchilla de la Angostura. Said blade is a narrow strip parallel to the marine coast where a rosary of shallow coastal lagoons develops, which connect directly with the sea (Laguna José Ignacio, Garzón, Rocha) or through emissaries (Laguna de Castillos). The Black Lagoon is the only one of the natural reservoirs of permanent fresh water that is located in the area of ​​interior plains, draining indirectly towards the Merín Lagoon. If we move from the western boundary of the basin to Laguna Merín, the territory gradually falls. First the "crystalline peneplain" is crossed, where the relief is of hills and hillocks, to then enter the "Eastern Plain", originated on powerful sedimentary deposits. The eastern plain is formed by important flat and low extensions in relation to sea level, presenting, consequently, strong drainage difficulties.


	...ARCHAEOLOGICAL PANORAMA OF THE SOUTHERN SECTOR OF LA MERINO LAGUNA BASIN

	The distribution of the different types of archaeological sites shows a high coincidence with the different environments present in the southern sector of the Merín Lagoon basin. This situation is generated by the form of occupation of the space developed by its prehistoric inhabitants, although archeological biases in the construction of the registry can not be ruled out. At the phenomenological level, for the region, we can order the registration in two large categories: sites with monticular structures (figures 5, 6 and 7) and sites without monticular structures.

	Sites without mound structures

	On the Atlantic coast, on sandy deposits, very long strips are observed with almost continuous surface distribution of artifacts, mainly lithic, where there is a profuse use of quartz as a raw material. Artificial fragments, flakes and cores dominate. Quartz and some local granite raw materials are the basis for dimpled stones, hands, mortars, scrapers and scrapers. To this series of formatted elements is added a characteristic type of projectile points, defined by its small size, for having been made in a wide range of raw materials, frequently of nonconcoidal fracture, made on flakes and, in a high proportion , only by perimeter and unifacial retouching. The exposition of these artifactual assemblies is subject to the dynamics of the sandy bodies (living dunes) that include them. Only in the sites of Cerro Verde, Punta la Coronilla and Cabo Polonio, high points associated with rocky points, the material has been located in a layer, although also in a sandy matrix (López 1994, 1994-95, López and Iriarte 1995, 2000) . In the Cabo Polonio site, the archaeological record shows the joint exploitation of marine and continental resources, with an apparent increase in the exploitation of the latter for the most recent moments. Two dates have been reported for this site: the earliest of 4370 ± 70 a. AP (URU 0005), not corresponding to the deepest cultural level; the most recent is 610 ± 65 to AP (URU 0004) (López 1994-95).

	...A novel situation on a regional scale has originated with the discovery of the first conchero on the oceanic coasts of Uruguay (López et al., 1997, Castiñeira et al., 2001, Bracco 2003). Sites characterized by accumulations of valves, sambaquíes 1, extend along the Brazilian coast up to approximately 800 km north of the border with Uruguay. Then until the southern end of the continent there are no other homologues: "concheros" (Castiñeira et al., 2001) 2. The La Esmeralda site is located on a beach arch that spans more than 40 km, between Punta Palmar and Punta Castillos Grande. This beach arch exhibits a series of cords that indicate the intense progradation that the coast has suffered in the last millennia, linked to the sustained relative descent of sea level from the maximum of the Holocene transgressor (ca. 6000 BC) ( Bracco and Ures 1998) (figure 8). The anthropic deposits are located 350 meters from the current coast line, observing three discrete sectors of different dimensions, concentration of biogenic material and position in the landscape (figure 9). This discontinuity, although accentuated by wind power, is possibly linked to the occupation dynamics. The presentation of the remains in pavement is a consequence of the action of the wind. Natural windows and soundings have made it possible to detect interstratification between wind-sand lenses and darker matrix levels with leaflet concentrations, with a total power of approximately 50 centimeters.

	...FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

	The archeology of the Merín lagoon basin has traveled a winding road in recent decades. Important advances in the magnitude of the research, in the production of data, in the contribution of interpretations, have been accompanied by marked biases and non-conformities, without achieving resolution designs. Today in a breaking point - despite the theoretical-methodological and technical advance of the discipline - as it did more than a century ago, the function of the Cerritos is presented as the core of the theme. It is not possible to ignore the difference in framing of the discussion, however we are still hostages of academic influences and preconceptions. We forget the obvious, that our sentences have to account for a reality and that their formulation is based on the jump, not from the possible to the plausible, but from the possible to the probable. Subsequently, the probable must resist new data and compromise other inferences that are again contrasted with reality. Each historical moment stamped and stamped its own cuneo, integrating from the idiosyncrasy of the researchers to the features of the current ideology. But this contingency does not enable any judgment to adjust to reality, no matter how diffuse the boundary between the plausible (which generates applause) and the probable. In every situation and moment science has admitted, not just any, but only certain affirmations, to then replace them with other "true" ones and not other affirmations. The quality of being contrasted, or their empirical basis, is what differentiates them from third sentences. And the attitude of contrasting them, or sustaining them in reality, is what must distinguish the creed. The mounds of the basin of the Merín lagoon necessarily fulfilled multiple functions. They have been proposed as funerary structures, ritual structures, housing platforms, cultural platforms, spatial indicators, cultural memory support, monuments, etc. (Table 4). The exclusion of any of them has rested, generally, in the absence of evidence (eg, non-existence of domestic structures) and not in the logical or empirical need for incompatibility. The functional approach and the use of empirical concepts (for example: "formative") 26 have conditioned the approach, keeping us almost at a phenomenal level, without accessing the cultural structure that generated this peculiar archaeological record. Registry that challenges the principles of logocentric discourse but challenges our capacity of anthropologists to understand how and why a human behavior has been repeated and perpetuated, probably only responding to the everyday.

ence of calcium carbonate deposits on many of the
vessels indicates that they likely fell in from Cave
II, since calcium carbonate cannot come out of
solution and coat a vessel underwater, and the depth
of the pool, which is fed by an active underground
river, makes it unlikely that it was ever dry for any
significant period of time.

	The focus of recent exploratory dives and surface excavations has been at Pool 1 (100 × 70 m), a cenote 60 + m deep surrounded by seven structures ( Fig. 4 ), including Structure 1 that we argue functioned as a water temple and pilgrimage destination during the Late and Terminal Classic periods, especially between ad 800 and 900.

	...Invisible from the surface is another portal — a massive cave on the north wall starting at 30 m deep with an entrance 40 m wide, which we named Actun Ek Nen, or Black Mirror Cave ( Fig. 5 ). It continues to the pool floor and north into the cliff for over 70 m; divers have not yet determined how far the cave extends into witz. Divers also discovered a geological bed c. 20–25 m deep laden with fossilized megafauna bones, of which they collected rib, vertebra and humerus specimens from an Eremotherium or giant sloth (McDonald 2011 ). AMS dates on wood fragments and gastropods from the fossil matrix date between c. 9000 and 39,000 years bp (Lucero 2012 ), the more recent end of which would fall in the realm of human occupation (Lohse et al. 2006 ). Four diving programs conducted between 2010 and 2013 have yielded intriguing artefacts and implications despite its depth, the obstacle course created by massive trees littering the sides and bottom, and sometimes the poor visibility due to hydrogen sulphide clouds caused by decomposing vegetation or debris caused by underwater excavations (Lucero 2011b ; 2012 ; 2014 ).

	...We have to wonder if they knew of the vast underwater cave, Actun Ek Nen, and would not be surprised if they did; we know they left offerings on ledges high up on cave walls that require spelunking gear and skill to reach today (e.g. at Actun Tunichil Muknal).

	“Discovered in 1989, Actun Tunichil Muknal, or ATM as it’s locally known, is not easy to reach. Brave travellers must take an hour’s ride from San Ignacio in Belize, then walk another hour through shallow rivers and jungle to reach the mouth of the cave.From here visitors have to swim into the cave and wade up the river for another kilometre past huge boulders and cavernous rooms,” writes Rowena.

	The  excavations  of  the  unit  followed  the   sam e  m ethods  as  Unit  1,  using  the  buckets   for scooping and screening the m atrix in the wate r.  The entirety of this unit required SCUBA  gear as it was located below 2.3 m eters of water  at the shallowest point.   Excavations of Unit  2  yielded  approxim ately  20  sm all  (2.2  cm   in   diam eter)  ceram ic  sherds.    The  artifacts   recovered from  this unit were, like those from  Unit 1, in extrem ely eroded condition, leaving  the tem pering agents exposed.  Again, the state  of these ceram ics is lik ely due to the erosive  action  of  the  water  over  the  course  of  long-dist ance  fluvial  transport.    The  fact  that  m ore   artif acts  ca me  out  of  Unit  2  than  Unit  1  m ay  be  indicative  of  the  force  of  the  water   displacem ent  in  the  two  areas.    Apparently,  le ss  m aterial  was  recovered  from   Unit  1  due  to   the  relative  variability   of  the  force  of  hydraulic  displace ment,  if  com pared  to  the  Unit  2   context,  which  is  further  down  the  stream   in  an   area  th at  is  not  as  restricted  and  wh ere  the water m ay not have been as forceful.  

	...After lowering the SCUBA equipment through the alternate sinkhole entrance to the cave and carrying it to th e Stelae Chamber, the unit was estab lished in an a rea be low th e sla te monum ents on a north-south axis. Logistica lly, this a rea was m uch m ore dif ficult to excavate for a num ber of reasons. The water was a deeper (F igure 5) m aking it difficult to transpo rt the excavated m aterial, and it was diff icult to keep our lights in place over the unit because th ere was nothing availab le on which to attach them . Maintainin g horizontal control of the unit was also problem atic. Upon reaching a depth of 58 c m, it becam e logistically im possible to continu e excavating Unit 3. In addition, the excavations reached a dept h where, although excavations continued, the walls would constantly slum p. Although Unit 3 was not e xcavated to bedrock, it was clo sed the sam e day it was opened due to the logi stical problem s m entioned. Surprisingly, no artifacts were recovered from this area.

	Over the years, Actun Tunichil Muknal Cave has also been ranked as the #1 sacred cave in the world by National Geographic.

	Speaking about the ATM Cave, Lloyd Alvarez, Cahal Pech Reservations Manager said that the ATM Tour (Actun Tunichil Muknal) can best be described as an “Indiana Jones” type experience and continues to be the most requested tour at Cahal Pech Village Resort.

	“Visitors have the opportunity to view impressive stalactites and stalagmites inside the cave along with Maya pottery that have been undisturbed for hundreds of years and your guide will reveal ancient passage ways and will share stories of Maya Gods and evidence of a Mayan princess burial scene,” Alvarez says .

	It was neither the ancient Maya's unlikely propensity for underwater living nor the SCAB project's love of working below the water table that focused the fieldwork in submerged locations: Instead, it was the realization that a rise in sea level had submerged substantial areas of the coast, dramatically reduced the land available for ancient settlement, and transformed the vegetation patterns. Settlement survey restricted to well-drained upland soils, where it was clear the ancient Maya preferred to live, would result in a diminished view of the settlement patters in the region.

The great achievements of the Maya were made by detailed observations of generations of skywatchers without the advantages of modem technology. They observed the sky for thousands of years and with such precision that their measurements of celestial events, such as the synodic period of Venus and the Maya calendar, were more precise than ours.

	Title: Skull of doom? Jane MacLaren Walsh uncovers the truth behind the celebrated Mitchell-hedges crystal skull, which has been shrouded in mystery and superstition since it first came to light in 1933. Said to have been found in a ruined Maya temple, is it really an ancient masterpiece? 


	Representations of human skulls carved from clear quartz, popularly known as crystal skulls, are among the most celebrated artefacts associated with ancient America. Although purportedly ancient and supposedly found in tombs, no single rock-crystal skull has ever been documented by an archaeologist from a controlled excavation. All quartz skulls in museum collections were purchased from dealers, or collectors. (1) The most celebrated example, however, has been in private hands since the 1930s. Known as the Mitchell-hedges skull, after F.A. Mitchell-hedges, who claimed to have discovered it in central America, it first appeared in London in 1933 (Fig. 1). According to MitchellHedges's adopted daughter, Anna, the skull was found by her under a fallen altar or inside a pyramid during an expedition that she and her father made to the Maya archaeological site of Lubaantun in Belize (then British Honduras), some time in the 1920s


https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17432200.2015.1059128
	In the nineteenth century, several skulls carved from rock crystal appeared in the holdings of European collectors. The provenance of the skulls was unknown and experts regarded them as pre-Columbian artifacts. In the twentieth century, two very different histories formed about these objects. Through testing and archival research, forensic experts and curators concluded that the skulls were created in the nineteenth century using European technology. Conversely, a community of skull enthusiasts believes the skulls are thousands of years old and function as a sort of esoteric computer. They believe that by communing with crystal skulls, it is possible to access records of ancient civilizations. The skull enthusiasts have strongly resisted the findings of experts. This article applies Tanya Luhrmann’s theory of “interpretive drift” to examine how the skull enthusiasts were able to construct and invest in a mythology surrounding these objects in only a few decades. This case study suggests that material objects can serve an important role in forming the types of magical worldviews outlined by Luhrmann.




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_skull
	The British Museum catalogues the skull's provenance as "probably European, 19th century AD"[43] and describes it as "not an authentic pre-Columbian artefact".[44] It has been established that this skull was made with modern tools, and that it is not authentic.[45]

	...In November 2007, Homann took the skull to the office of anthropologist Jane MacLaren Walsh, in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History for examination.[38] Walsh carried out a detailed examination of the skull using ultraviolet light, a high-powered light microscope, and computerized tomography. Homann took the skull to the museum again in 2008 so it could be filmed for a Smithsonian Networks documentary, Legend of the Crystal Skull and on this occasion Walsh was able to take two sets of silicone molds of surface tool marks for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. The SEM micrographs revealed evidence that the crystal had been worked with a high speed, hard metal rotary tool coated with a hard abrasive such as diamond. Walsh's extensive research on artifacts from Mexico and Central America showed that pre-contact artisans carved stone by abrading the surface with stone or wooden tools and in later pre-Columbian times, copper tools, in combination with a variety of abrasive sands or pulverized stone. These examinations led Walsh to the conclusion that the skull was probably carved in the 1930s, and was most likely based on the British Museum skull which had been exhibited fairly continuously from 1898.[38]

They said the value of findings at the newly discovered wreck could far exceed the nearly $4 million that their private backers have so far invested in their operations.

	Initially afraid that they had accidentally stumbled upon a secret U.S. military installation, the pair did not reveal their finding for months. However Paul, after puzzling over the identity of the structures one day, glanced at a wall calendar one day which contained pictures of Mayan pyramids, and made the connection — the underwater structures were pyramids! The intrepid pair then resolved to get a closer look, and in July of 2001, one year after they had originally spotted the enigmatic structures, they teamed up with Cuban geologist Manuel Iturralde to perform further investigations. 



why is there so much bullshit going on with this discovery

	Because  the
	isostatic terms are relatively small, isostatic predic-
	tions for sites within this zone are less dependent on
	details of the ice models than for near-field sites and
	observations from these localities would provide bet-
	ter constraints on the eustatic function. Of the sites
	considered in this paper, only Jamaica and possibly
	Barbados lie within this zone.

	The Barbados record was not used in early iterations because it is from the outer edge of the geoidal bulge around the North American ice sheet and sea-level response there may be more sensitive to δζisoice(ϕ,t) than sites further from the ice margin, as well as to potential differences in mantle viscosity beneath continents and oceans and local mantle structure associated with the descending lithospheric slab (50). However, tests with and without this data yielded near-identical results for both E and δζesl(t), and, in all subsequent iterations, observations from Barbados (but not from other Caribbean sites closer to the former ice margin) have been included.


what's up with that?
