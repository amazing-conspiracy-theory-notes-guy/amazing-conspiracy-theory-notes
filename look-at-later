what stories did medeival people tell each other? apparently they didn't like the clergy


what stories did clergy tell the public? "life in a medieval city" gives examples of a sermon (in vernacular) with moral of not desiring money and telling them to be worried about heretics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_IX

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Melfi

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Civitate#Aftermath
	After preparing a siege of the town of Civitate itself, the Pope was taken prisoner by the victorious Normans.

	There is some uncertainty over how this happened. Papal sources say that Leo left Civitate and surrendered himself to prevent further bloodshed.[citation needed] Other sources including Malaterra indicate that the inhabitants of Civitate handed over the Pope and drove him "out of the gates," after seeing the Norman threat manifested in siege towers and earthen ramparts.[14] He was treated respectfully but was imprisoned at Benevento for almost nine months, and forced to ratify a number of treaties favorable to the Normans. However, according to the Norman accounts, Leo was treated more as an honored guest than as a prisoner, and by no means lacked for comforts, Amatus claims that "they continually furnished him with wine, bread, and all the necessities," and was "protected" by the Normans until he returned to Rome ten months later.[15] According to John Julius Norwich, Leo attempted a long, passive resistance to agreeing to anything for the Normans, and was waiting for an imperial relief army from Germany. In addition, Norwich believes that despite the lack of concrete support until later popes, Leo did eventually acknowledge the Normans as the rulers of the South in order to get a release for his freedom.[16] Meanwhile, Argyros and the Byzantine army were forced to disband and return to Greece via Bari, since their forces were not strong enough to fight the Normans now that the papal forces had been defeated. Argyros may even have been banished from the Empire by Constantine himself.[17]


what was going on here? remember another wikipedia source saying the normans still liked the pope are were acting all reverent to him even after capturing him

looks like this might be a good book

https://archive.org/stream/pressandsociety030075mbp/pressandsociety030075mbp_djvu.txt
	In preparing the revised edition of this book, the editors have 
	found that the period of World War II produced relatively little re- 
	search devoted to the press. Since that period excellent studies have 
	been published with increasing frequency, however, and upon these 
	latter years the editors have drawn heavily. 

	The primary purpose of the editors has been to preserve the his- 
	torical depth of the book, so that young students may learn what 
	critics of the press formerly held to be true. These students may de- 
	cide from their own experience and from the writings of present-day 
	critics whether the old opinions are still tenable. A few statements 
	about the press have become landmarks of scholarly reference. These 
	have been retained. Citations that relied heavily upon statistics of 
	the day have been replaced in order to give a truer postwar picture.
