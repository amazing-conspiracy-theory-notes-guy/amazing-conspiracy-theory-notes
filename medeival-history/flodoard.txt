https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Empire
	The Carolingian Empire (800–888) was a large empire in western and central Europe during the early Middle Ages. It was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty, which had ruled as kings of the Franks since 751 and as kings of the Lombards of Italy from 774. In 800, the Frankish king Charlemagne was crowned emperor in Rome by Pope Leo III in an effort to revive the Roman Empire in the west during a vacancy in the throne of the eastern Roman Empire. After a civil war (840–43) following the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, the empire was divided into autonomous kingdoms, with one king still recognised as emperor, but with little authority outside his own kingdom. The unity of the empire and the hereditary right of the Carolingians continued to be acknowledged.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Verdun
	The Treaty of Verdun, signed in August 843, was the first of the treaties that divided the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms among the three surviving sons of Louis the Pious, who was the son of Charlemagne. The treaty, signed in Verdun-sur-Meuse, ended the three-year Carolingian Civil War.

	...The division of the Frankish realm by the Treaty of Verdun, carried out without any regard to linguistic and cultural continuities, resulted in conflicts in Western Europe until the 20th century.[3] Since the Middle Frankish Kingdom combined lengthy and vulnerable land borders with poor internal communications as it was severed by the Alps, it was not a viable entity and soon fragmented. This made it difficult for a single ruler to reassemble Charlemagne's empire. Only Charles the Fat achieved this briefly.

	In 855, the northern section became fragile Lotharingia, which became disputed by the more powerful states that evolved out of West Francia (i.e., France) and East Francia (i.e., Germany). Generations of kings of France and Germany were unable to establish a firm rule over Lothair’s kingdom.[4]


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Empire
	In 884, Charles the Fat reunited all the kingdoms for the last time, but he died in 888 and the empire immediately split up. With the only remaining legitimate male of the dynasty a child, the nobility elected regional kings from outside the dynasty or, in the case of the eastern kingdom, an illegitimate Carolingian. The illegitimate line continued to rule in the east until 911, while in the western kingdom the legitimate Carolingian dynasty was restored in 898 and ruled until 987 with an interruption from 922 to 936.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Francia
	Reign of Charles the Fat

	After the death of Charles's grandson, Carloman II, on December 12, 884, the West Frankish nobles elected his uncle, Charles the Fat, already king in East Francia and Kingdom of Italy, as their king. ...His reign was the only time after the death of Louis the Pious that all of Francia would be re-united under one ruler. ...His handling of the Viking siege of Paris in 885–86 greatly reduced his prestige. In November 887 his nephew, Arnulf of Carinthia revolted and assumed the title as King of the East Franks. Charles retired and soon died on January 13, 888.

	In Aquitaine, Duke Ranulf II may have had himself recognised as king, but he only lived another two years.[12] Although Aquitaine did not become a separate kingdom, it was largely outside the control of the West Frankish kings.[3]

	Odo, Count of Paris was then elected by nobles as the new king of West Francia, and was crowned the next month. At this point, West Francia was composed of Neustria in the west and in the east by Francia proper, the region between the Meuse and the Seine.

	Rise of Robertians

	After the 860s, Lotharingian noble Robert the Strong became increasingly powerful as count of Anjou, Touraine and Maine. Robert's brother Hugh, abbot of Saint-Denis, was given control over Austrasia by Charles the Bald. Robert's son Odo was elected king in 888.[13] Odo's brother Robert I ruled between 922 and 923 and was followed by Rudolph from 923 until 936.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_the_Simple#Revolt_of_the_nobles
	Revolt of the nobles

	...By this time Charles' excessive favouritism towards a certain Hagano had turned the aristocracy against him. He endowed Hagano with monasteries that were already the benefices of other barons, alienating them. In Lotharingia he earned the enmity of the new duke Gilbert, who in 919 declared loyalty to the new king of East Francia Henry the Fowler.[6] Opposition to Charles in Lotharingia was not universal, however; he retained support of Wigeric.

	The nobles, completely exasperated with Charles' policies and especially his favoritism of count Hagano, seized Charles in 920.[9] After negotiations by Archbishop Herveus of Reims the king was released.[9]


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flodoard
	Flodoard (of Reims) (893/4 – 28 March 966) was a canon, chronicler, and presumed archivist of the cathedral church of Reims in the West Frankish kingdom during the decades following the dissolution of the Carolingian Empire.

	THE ANNALS OF FLODOARD

	I.

	In the year 919 from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, a marvelous hailstone fell at Reims. It was larger than a hen's egg and was wider than half a person's palm. However, even larger hail was seen to have fallen in certain other places. This year there was no wine in the pagus of Reims, or much too little. The Northmen ravaged, destroyed and annihilated all of Brittany in Cournouaille, which is located on the seashore. The Bretons were abducted and sold, while those who escaped were driven out. The Magyars raided Italy and part of Francia, that is, Lothair's Kingdom.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_invasions_of_Europe
	The Hungarian invasions of Europe (Hungarian: kalandozások, German: Ungarneinfälle) took place in the 9th and 10th centuries, the period of transition in the history of Europe between the early and high medieval period, when the territory of the former Carolingian Empire was threatened by invasion from multiple hostile forces, the Magyars (Hungarians) from the east, the Norsemen from the north and the Arabs from the south.[1][2]


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagano
	In 919 the West Frankish barons refused to assist the king in repelling a Magyar invasion.[2] One of the leading Lotharingian barons, Gilbert, threw his support behind Henry the Fowler, the German king, and, according to Flodoard, was elected "prince" (princeps) by the Lotharingian aristocracy.[3]

	2.

	In the year 920 from the Lord's incarnation, almost all the counts of Francia gathered at the urbs of Soissons and abandoned their King Charles. This was done because Charles was unwilling to dismiss his counselor Hagano, a man of middling origins whom Charles had raised to power.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagano
	Hagano[1] was a petty nobleman (mediocris) who achieved influence in Lotharingia and West Francia during the rule of Charles the Simple (898–922). He was a relative of Charles' first wife, Frederuna, and was originally from Lotharingia. Though Frederuna had died in 917, by 918 Hagano had become the king's favourite and his most trusted advisor. The aristocracy despised him, however, and the authority of Charles over the nobles was severely weakened by Hagano's presence at court.[2]


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	However, Heriveus, the archbishop of Reims, received the king after they all had deserted him and led the king to his house in the villa of Chacrise. 


	...3.

	In the year 921 of the Incarnate Word

	...King Charles went into Lothair's Kingdom and retook by force certain fortifications (praesidia) of Ricuinus, who was unfaithful to Charles. After a pact was made with Henry, the Transrhenish princeps, which was to last until the feast of Saint Martin [11 November], he returned to the Mount of Laon.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_the_Fowler
	Henry the Fowler (German: Heinrich der Finkler or Heinrich der Vogler; Latin: Henricus Auceps) (876 – 2 July 936) was the duke of Saxony from 912 and the elected king of East Francia (Germany) from 919 until his death in 936. As the first non-Frankish king, he established the Ottonian Dynasty of kings and emperors, and he is generally considered to be the founder and first king of the medieval German state, known until then as East Francia.

	...For give months Count Robert [of Paris] besieged the Northmen who were operating on the river Loire. After he received hostages from them, he conceded Britanny to the Northmen, which they had devastated, along with the pagus of Nantes. The Northmen began to take up the faith of Christ.

	...Again, King Charles confirmed the peace with Henry [king of Germany].



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_the_Simple
	From 920 to 922, Charles the Simple was in trouble. Although he pacified his relations with king Henry the Fowler of East Francia, he had to fight on two fronts: one against Duke Giselbert of Lotharingia and the other against Hugh the Great, irritated by the treatment of his mother-in-law. Defeated, in June 922 Charles the Simple took refuge in Lotharingia, and the nobles of the West Francia declared him deposed from the throne, choosing as the new King Robert, Count of Paris, brother of the late King Odo and father of Hugh the Great.[16]

	In the year 922, in the prosecution of Gislebert and Otho, Charles laid waste to Lothair's Kingdom with rapine, sacrileges and fires, even campaigning in the seaons of lent and for the entire winter.

	...Charles returned to Laon and, after Easter [21 April], Hugh [the Great], the son of [Count] Robert came across the Vesle to the villa of Fismes, where he met with jideles of Archbishop Heriveus [of Reims], along with certain of the counts of Francia. Hugh set out with these men on the river Aisne in the pagus of Laon on account of Hagano, to whom the king had given the abbey of Chelles, which had belonged to Rothildis, Charles's aunt and the mother-in-law of Hugh. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_the_Great
	Hugh the Great (c.895 – 16 June 956) was the Duke of the Franks and Count of Paris.

	He was the son of King Robert I of France and Béatrice of Vermandois, daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois.[1] He was born in Paris, Île-de-France, France. His eldest son was Hugh Capet who became King of France in 987.[2] His family is known as the Robertians.[3]


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagano
	Charles' sin appears to be transferring grants in benefice, especially of monasteries, from his barons to Hagano.[3] When, in 922, he granted Hagano Chelles, at that time already held by Rothilde, a daughter of Charles the Bald, the barons of West Francia revolted and made Robert king in Charles' place.

	French historian Charles Bémont edited a document (#5 in manuscript 9016 of the Bibliothèque nationale de France) for the pièces justificatives of his biography of Simon de Montfort in which a baron reminds Henry III of England of what happened to "Charles l'Assoté" when he listened too closely to unpopular advisors.[4]


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	Charles secretly departed from Laon, along with Heribert [of Vermandois] and Hagano, because of his love for Hagano, and set across the Meuse because of his fear. Hugh, with 2000 other fighting men (pugnatores), followed Charles across the Meuse and met there with Gislebert the Lotharingian. Hugh returned with Gislebert and was summoned to a meeting by his father [Robert], who had followed him and was encamped on the Aisne in the pagus of Laon. When Charles learned of this, he recrossed the Meuse with many Lotharingians who had joined him and he began to raid and burn villae of the church of Reims. By military action Charles took and made indefensible the castrum of Omont, but his own troops suffered considerable losses. Therefore, [Count] Robert proceeded to the Marne to meet Raoul, the son of Richard [the Justicar] and his own son-in-law. Charles followed him and crossed the Marne with the Lotharingians, while the confederates of Hagano captured the castrum of Epernay. When Raoul arrived with the Burgundians, 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_of_France
	Rudolph of France

	Rudolph or Rudolf (Latin: Rodulfus, French: Rodolphe; c. 890 – 14/15 January 936) was the elected King of France from 923 until his death in 936. Prior to his election as king, he was Duke of Burgundy and Count of Troyes from 921. He was the son of Richard, Duke of Burgundy and Adelaide of Auxerre inheriting the Duchy of Burgundy from his father. He married Emma of France, daughter of king Robert I of France.

	...Rodulf and Rudolf are variants of this name; the French form is Rodolphe. By contrast, the king is normally known as Raoul in modern French


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	[Count] Robert crossed the river [Marne] below Epernay and laid out his fortified camp {castra) not more than three leagues from the army of Charles. There both Robert and Raoul remained encamped for more than a week and met in a conference without Hagano and Charles.

	Meanwhile, Hugh [the Black], the son of Richard [the Justicar], came to [Count] Robert and attacked about 200 men who had been in alliance with Hagano [and] who were setting out to plunder villae of the diocese of Reims.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_the_Black
	Hugh the Black (died 952) was Duke of Burgundy from 923 until his death in 952. He was a Bosonid through his father, who was the younger brother of Boso of Provence.

	Hugh was the son of Richard of Autun, Duke of Burgundy, and Adelaide of Auxerre. He succeeded his older brother Rudolph as Duke of Burgundy, when Rudolph was elected King of West Francia, as Raoul, in 923.[1]

	Following Raoul's death in 936, Hugh may have had aspirations to follow his brother onto the throne and refused to recognize Louis IV as king of West Francia. As a result, Louis sent Hugh the Great who captured Auxerre and Sens.[2] The Duchy of Burgundy was divided between Hugh the Great and Hugh the Black.[1]


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	Some of these men were captured and three were killed. He lod off some horses and captured some weapons. He sent back the surviving prisoners to their own people, burdened with shame. After these events transpired, Robert and King Chalres laid out their camps, the former at Chaumuz and the latter in the vicinity of Reims, a league away from the civitas. There Charles's forces sat for three straight days, with many of their horses being captured by the townsmen (cives) of Reims. In response, Charles's forces attacked the urbs even though it was Pentecost Sunday [9 June]. As a result many of the Lotharingians were killed and many others were wounded before night ended the battle. Finally, it was heard that those who were with Robert had captured Laon and that Hagano's treasures that were in the city had been scattered and that Robert's men had seized one of Hagano's brothers. Charles and Hagano then advanced on Laon. Some of the Lotharingians returned hume but others continued on wit Charles. Robert had pitched his tents on the river Allette. Charles, denied an entry to Laon, settled on the river Serre. Each day Robert's forces increased while those of Charles diminished. Finally Charles secretly withdrew with Hagano and set out across the Meuse.

	The Franks chose Robert as their lord (senior) and committed themselves to him. Thus Robert was established as king at Reims, at [the monastery of] St-Remi, by the bishops and magnates (primates) of the kingdom. Heriveus, the [arch]bishop of Reims, died on the third day after the consecration of King Robert, that is, on 2 July, on the fourth day before he would have completed the twenty-second year of his episcopate. He was succeeded as an archbishop of Reims by Seulfus, who was then holding the office of archdeacon in Reims. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flodoard
	According to local tradition, Flodoard was born at Épernay. He was educated at the cathedral school of Reims which had been established by Archbishop Fulk (882–900).[1]

	As a canon of Reims, and favourite of the archbishops Heriveus (d. 922) and Seulf (d. 925), he occupied while still young an important position in the archiepiscopal ministry, and in particular in the cathedral scriptorium.

	At Cambrai it seemed that three suns appeared, or that the sun had three orbs equally distant from each other. Likewise two sun rays appeared on opposite sides of the sun but in close proximity to it until they were covered by a cloud. Likewise two beams of light were close together in the sky until they, too, were covered by a cloud.

	[King] Robert sent his son Hugh [the Great] into Lothair's Kingdom with a military force (agmen) of the Franks to free from investment Gislebert's castrum of Chievremont, to which Charles was laying siege. When Charles learned of Hugh's approach, he raised the siege. Hugh received hostages from certain Lotharingians and returned to his father.

	5.

	In the year 923 [King] Robert set out for Lothair's Kingdom to speak with King Henry [of Germany], who came to meet him in the pagus of the Ripuarians on the river Rur [Roer]. There they feared each other's power. After they had made a pact of friendship, they exchanged gifts and departed. At the same time, certain Lotharingians gave hostages and they received a truce from Robert that was to last until the first day of October.

	The Northmen raided Aquitaine and the Auvergne. William, the duke of the Aquitanians, and Raymond [count of Toulouse] fought against them, and 12,000 of the Northmen were killed there.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II,_Duke_of_Aquitaine
	William II the Young (died 12 December 926) was the Count of Auvergne and Duke of Aquitaine from 918 to his death, succeeding his uncle William I.

	William was son of the Acfred I of Carcassonne and Adelinde, William I's sister and Bernard Plantapilosa's daughter. Immediately after succeeding his uncle, he made war on the Burgundians and Normans, who refused to accept Rudolph as king of France. His support of the king, however, was insincere. He later revolted and Rudolph led an army into Aquitaine, but was called back to defend the Rhine from the Magyars. William died soon after.


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	[King] Charles crossed the Meuse and came to Attigny along with his Lotharingians, who had broken the truce that they had recently received from [King] Robert. Before Robert was able to assemble his fideles, Charles and his forces suddenly arrived on the Aisne, where he learned that Robert was encamped beneath the urbs of Soissons. On the next day, a Sunday [15 June], after the sixth hour [noon] had passed, when the Franks were not expecting a battle that day and many of them were eating their meals, Charles crossed the Aisne and attacked Robert with the well armed Lotharingians who were with him. Robert, however, counterattacked Charles with his own well armed men. The battle began and many fell on each side. King Robert also died, pierced through by lances.

	However, those who were on Robert's side, that is, his son Hugh [the Great] and Heribert [count of Vermandois] and others, were able to gain the victory. They forced Charles and his Lotharingians to retreat in flight. But because of the death of their king Robert they did not pursue the defeated, but rather they took control of their camp and seized spoils, especially from the country folk (rusticani) and from those who streamed out from the suburb of the urbs of Soissons. Finally, the Lotharingians lost many wagons to Count Roger [of Laon], who brought them into the castrum of Laon. The Lotharingians left Charles behind in the kingdom of Francia and they returned home.

	Charles sent out many delegations to prevail upon Count Heribert [of Vermandois] and Archbishop Seulfus and the rest of the magnates (primates) of the kingdom to support him once again. They rejected his request and sent to Burgundy for Raoul, who swiftly hurried to them with a large force of his own men. When the Franks heard that Charles had summoned the Northmen to come to him, they took up a position with Raoul between Charles and the Northmen on the river Oise, preventing them from joining forces.

	...in 923, the beleaguered king appealed to Rollo and his Normans for military assistance. Charles's enemies prevented their forces from uniting, but 923 nonetheless saw Norman raids on the pagi across the Oise


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	Then Charles fled back across the Meuse and all of them [the Franks] chose Raoul as king.

	Raoul, the son of Richard [the Justiciar], was established as king at the urbs of Soissons. Count Heribert [of Vermandois] directed his cousin Bernard, along with other legates who were unaware of their plan, to go to Charles. Charles was persuaded by their oaths and set out to Heribert with a few of his men. Heribert received Charles in his own castellum of St-Quentin, on the Somme. Heribert sent away those who had come with Charles and had Charles taken to Chateau-Thierry a minitio of his on the river Marne. There Heribert placed Charles in custody with the necessary provisions and then followed King Raoul into Burgundy.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_II,_Count_of_Vermandois
	Herbert II (died 23 February 943), Count of Vermandois, Count of Meaux, and Count of Soissons. He was the first to exercise power over the territory that became the province of Champagne.

	...In 923, Count Herbert took the bold step of imprisoning King Charles III, who died still a captive in 929.[a][3] 


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	Meanwhile, Ragenold, the princeps of the Northmen who were engaged on the river Loir, had for a long time been stirred up by Charles's frequent messages and now crossed the Oise and raided Francia, joined by many from Rouen.


https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo
	While Rollo was given lands around Rouen in 911 by the French king, Flodoard of Reims says that there were many bands of Northmen raiding in western France at the time.[6] In his writing he paid more attention to another group of Vikings under a Ragenold.


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	Heribert's jideles unexpectedly overcame the the camp of the forces from Rouen, who had remained in their castella. Count Raoul [of Goucy], stepson of Roger [count of Laon], and Count Ingobrannus joined Heribert and they took great spoils and liberated from captivity 1000 prisoners there. When Ragenold learned this he was enraged and ravaged the pagus of Arras. Count Adelemus [of Arras] came out to meet him and killed 600 of the invaders while the others slipped away in flight. Ragenold hurried with his men to take refuge in his munitiones, from where he continued carrying out plunderings and brigandage as he could.

	Because of all these actions, King Raoul was summoned from Burgundy to Compiegne, on the Oise, by Hugh [the Great], the son of [King] Robert. Upon hearing that the Northmen had plundered the pagus of Beau-vais, Raoul crossed [the Oise to Beavais], along with Archbishop Seulfus, Count Heribert [of Vermandois] and certain other select brave men. They crossed the Epte and entered the land that had been given to the Northmen when they had come to the faith of Christ shortly before, so that they might cultivate the faith and have peace. King Raoul and the Franks devestated part of this land with fire and sword because those Northmen had broken the peace which they had earlier agreed to with King Charles, who [now] promised them a vast expanse of land. Envoys from the Lotharingians went to Raoul, who was engaged in these operations, promising that they would place themselves and their possessions under him. Raoul was diverted from his campaign of devastation by this delegation and he went out to meet the Lotharingians on the advice of the magnates (primates) who were with him. He left Count Hugh [the Great] and Count Heribert [of Vermandois] behind across [the east bank of] the Oise to protect the fatherland. Those Lotharingians came to meet Raoul at Mouzon.

	Meanwhile, Raoul's wife Emma was consecrated queen at Reims by Archbishop Selfus. Raoul was elevated to power (regnum) by many Lotharingians and was asked by Bishop Wigeric of Metz to go to recapture the castrum of Savarne in the pagus of Alsace. He remained there for almost the entire autumn because the garrison (castellant), which was from across the Rhine, held out, vainly awating aid from [King] Henry. At last Raoul received hostages from them and returned to Laon to his wife.


https://books.google.com/books?id=dBIABQAAQBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21
	Following the death of King Robert, the West Frankish magnates, joined by many secular and ecclesiastical principes in Lotharingia, chose Duke Raoul of Burgundy (died 936), the son-in-law of Robert, as king. Amonth these Lotharingian magnates was Bishop Wigeric of Metz (917-927) who sought the aid of the new West Frankish king in besieging Savarne. Henry's troops held the fortification throughout the autumn of 923, but eventually capitulated when the German king failed to send reinforcements. The Rheims historian Flodoard records that Bishop Wigeric then burned Savarne to the ground.


https://books.google.com/books?id=OpsTS-E_pFgC&
	Meanwhile, the Northmen raided certain of our pagi across the Oise, and our people raided their land. After numerous embassies passed back and forth, the Northmen promised to make peace with Count Heribert [of Vermandois], Archbishop Seulfus and the other Franks who were encamped with them against the Northmen. This was on the condition that the more spacious land beyond the Seine, which they had requested, would be given to them. In the meantime, as was said, King Raoul returned to Laon, and the Northmen sent hostages and accepted a truce from the king to last until the middle of May.

	As these things were happening, it became known that Henry [king of Germany], at the invitation of Count Gislebert [of Lotharingia] and [Arch]bishop Roger of Trier, who had not yet submitted themselves to [King] Raoul, crossed the Rhine and raided Lothair's Kingdom. He laid waste the area between the Rhine and the Moselle, carried off herds and plow animals, drained away other resources and captured many people, including youths. When Henry heard that Raoul was gathering an army not only from Francia but also from all Burgundy, he retired into his own kingdom after agreeing to a truce with the Lotharingians to last unil the first day of October of the following year. However, Otho [count of Verdun] deserted to Henry, along with those who had committed themselves to Raoul. Bishop Wigeric [of Metz] destroyed Saverne after recapturing it. Cambrai was set ablaze as a result of a fire that was not watched carefully.

	...The archiepiscopal woolen band, which is called the pallium, was sent to Archbishop Seulfus by Pope John [X].


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallium
	The pallium (derived from the Roman pallium or palla, a woolen cloak; pl.: pallia) is an ecclesiastical vestment in the Roman Catholic Church,[n 1] originally peculiar to the Pope, but for many centuries bestowed by him on metropolitans and primates as a symbol of the jurisdiction delegated to them by the Holy See.[1] In that context, it has remained connected to the papacy.[2] [3]

	6.

	Early in the year 924, a tax in money was collected throughout Francia, which was handed over to the Northmen for a pact of peace. King Raoul prepared a journey into Aquitaine because William [II], the princeps of that region, had delayed making his personal submission. When William learned that Raou was hurrying into Aquitaine with a hostile force, he came to met him in the Loire. With representatives from each side going back and forth, at last William and Raoul met on the Loire, in the pagus of Autun. There they remained the whole day, with Raoul on this bank of the river and Willian on that bank as messengers traveled back and forth. Thus as the entire day passed, William finally crossed the river and came to Raoul at night. William vaulted from his horse and, on foot, approached the king, who was mounted on his horse. The king kissed him on both cheeks and he departed. On the next day, William returned to the king and they both agreed to a truce of eight days. After a week had passed, William committed himself to the king and the king restored to William the pagus of Berry. Earlier Raoul, assisted by Robert [count of Paris], who had not yet been made king, had taken it and the civitas of Bourges away from William by force. Raoul gave Peronne to Heribert [of Vermandois] and Le Mans to Hugh [the Great], [King] Robert's son. Archbishop Seulfus regained the adjacent land of St-Remi in the province of Lyon from Hugh of Vienne, who had been preset at the same meeting. [Arch]bishop Heriveus [of Reims] had held nothing of this land.

	Having returned from there, we came to the castellum of Mont-St-Jean, which Ragenardus had invaded and held. However, at the urging of his nephews Walo and Gislebert and others whom the king had sent to retake the stronghold, Ragenardus sent his son to the king as a hostage. The king, at the urging of Ragenardus's kinsmen and of his own brother Hugh [the Black], ordered that all the hostage by received and granted a truce to Ragenardus. All the others were were with Ragendaruds he left bound to him by an oath.

	Renaud or Ragenold, Count of Roucy (b: abt 920 or 923, 931 - d: 10 May 967) was a Viking who became the military chief of Reims after the restoration of Artald of Reims. He'd built a fort at Roucy between late 940s and early 950s and supported young King Lothair of France in the expedition at Aquitaine and the Siege (fr) of Poitiers. Renaud became the Count of Roucy around or before 955 by King Lothair.

	He married Alberade of Lorraine, daughter of Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine around 945 and had four children

	...Renaud could have a brother named Dodo according to Flodoard, but it could be a name of place where Renaud's brother was located.

	The person of Count Rainald of Roucy was probably identical or related to the leader of a Norman army called Ragenold ( Ragenoldus, princeps Nortmannorum ), who in the years 923 and 925 plundered through the Loire Valley and invaded the Oise in Burgundy , but there was one Defeat suffered. He was besieged by King Rudolf in his winter camp near Arras in 926, but wounded him during a successful night's outage and routed his army. [1]

	The Count's identity with the Norman leader is widely accepted in the recent literature, but due to the large time interval of twenty years, a separation of the two persons is considered, according to which the Norman Ragenold would have been the father of Count Rainald.

	...Rainald is first mentioned in 944, when he and his brother Dodo were presented by King Louis IV the Overseas with Montigny-Lengrain (now in the Département Aisne ). In the same year he invaded the Abbey of Saint-Médard of Soissons .

	Meanwhile, Berengar, who was married to the sister of Gislebert [of Lotharingia], captured his brother-in-law. When the sons of Ragenarius, who was Gislebert's brother, were given to Berengar as hostages, he released Gislebert. Upon his freedom, Gislebert repeatedly devastated the lands of Berengar and of his own brother Ragenarius and of Count Issac [of Cambrai]. Afterwards, Giselbert sent envoys to King Raoul so that he might be received by the king. The king detested the perjuries and inconstancy of Gislebert and, with the counsel of hisjideles, refused to recieve him.

	...Raoul, the king of Francia, held a placitum at Attigny where he prepared an expedition into Lothair's Kingdom. However, he was struck down by a serious illness. As his strength returned, just as it seemed that he was recovering, he suffered a severe relapse. Many despaired for him and he asked to be taken to [the monastery of] St-Remi at Reims. Raoul was generous and gave many gifts to monasteries of Francia and Burgundy, excluding his wife's share of their goods. He remained at St-Remi for four weeks until his health returned, and finally he went to the urbs of Soissons before returning to Burgundy.

	Henry [king of Germany] was in the lands bordering on the Sarmatians when he, like Raoul, fell ill and was delayed for the entire summer. Meanwhile, a dispute arose between Gislebert [of Lotharingia] and his brother Ragenarius, as well as conflict between Otho and Boso. The result was killings, fires and raids by both sides. The Northmen made a peace with the Franks by oaths, due to the efforts of Count Hugh [the Great], Count Heribert [of Vermandois], and Archbishop Seulfus because King Raoul was absent. However, with the king's consent, more lands were conceded to the Northmen in a pact of peace, that is, Maine and the Bessin.

	In a surprise attack Count Issac [of Cambrai] captured and burned a castellum of Bishop Stephen of Cambrai. In a sudden fire he also burned the tower of the citadel (praesidium) of Heribert, which was on the river Marne, where [King] Charles was being held [Chateau-Thierry]. Ragenoldus with his Northmen laid waste the lands of Hugh [the Great], between the Loire and the Seine, because they had not yet been given possessions inside the Gauls.

	In October a synod of the bishops of the province of Reims was held at Trosly-Loire, with Archbishop Seulfus [of Reims] presiding. Count Issac [of Cambrai] came to the synod to make amends and to give satisfaction for the things that he had perpetrated against the Church of Cambrai. Issac bound over a hundred pounds of silver and made peace with Bishop Stephen [of Cambrai] in the presence of [Count] Heribert [of Vermandois] and many other counts of Francia. King Raoul received the castellum of Mont-St-Jean, which Ragenardus [viscount of Auxerre] had reluctantly abandoned, and he again sought out Francia. William [II of Aquitaine] and Hugh [the Great], son of Robert, made a security pact for their lands with Ragenoldus, and Ragenoldus and his Northmen set out into Burgundy.

	In this year there were many lightings of candles in different parts of Francia, with the light arising suddenly. Moreoever, visions of the saints were shown to Ebrulfus, a certain priest living in the nearby small village of Mouzon. At Reims, in the church of Saint Mary, on the feast of all Saints [in November], a man who had been crippled for a long time with his calves drawn back to the hamstrings was healed by divine power and he stood up.

	It was reported that the Magyars who were ravaging Gothia suffered a plauge, which caused dysentery and welling of their heads, and very few survived.

	7.

	When the year 925 began, Ragenoldus with his Northmen devastated Burgundy. Count Warnerius [of Troyes], Manasses, Bishop Ansegisus [of Troyes], and Bishop Gozcelinus [of Langres] joined forces to oppose them at Mons Calaus and killed more than 800 of the Northmen. However, Count Warnerius was captured and killed when the horse on which he was mounted was killed, and Bishop Ansegisus of Troyes was wounded. When King Raoul learned of this, he set out to Burgundy with certain soldiers from Francia, that is, those from the church of Reims, along with Bishop Abbo of Soissons and a few others who escorted him, including Heribert [of Vermandois]. When he collected a substantial number of soldiers from Burgundy, he advanced to the fortified camp of the Northmen on the river Seine, where there was a struggle fought on foot. When the Northmen saw that those who were with the king, that is, the greatest part of the army, made no effort either to capture their camp or even to dismount, they came out of their camp to fight. After suffering losses the Franks broke off the engagement and laid out their camp in a circular pattern two or three miles away from the camp of the Northmen. Hugh [the Great], the son of Robert, laid out his own camp on the opposite bank of the Seine. Thus from day to day the franks were delaying establishing a close siege of the Northmen's encampment as they awaited ships to come from Paris. However, with the complicity of some of our men, as it is said, the Northmen broke out of their camp and sought the cover of a certain forest to shield their movement and some of our own men returned home.

	When the Lenten fasts were begun, Heribert [count of Vermandois] spoke with Gislebert [of Lotharingia] and then with Hugh [the Great], and then summoned King Raoul from Burgundy. Raoul hurried to meet him and set out for Cambrai in order to meet the Lotharingians and Gislebert. However, these latter ones did not attend the placitum and came to Raoul on the Meuse. Gislebert and Otho were made Raoul's supporters.

	The Northmen from Rouen broke the treaty to which they had formerly agreed and laid waste the pagus of Beavais and Amiens. The dvitas of Amiens was burned because a fire had been poorly tended by the refugees, and Arras was burned in a fire that suddenly arose. The Northmen came to plunder Noyon and they set fire to its suburbs. The garrison troops (castellani) of Noyon came out with the inhabitants of the suburbs and rove off the Northmen, killing those whom they were able and freeing part of the suburb from the enemy. Meanwhile, the men of the Bessin raided the land of the Northmen on the other side of the Seine. When news of this came, the men of Paris, along with some the fideles of Hugh [the Great], son of Robert, and with the garrison troops (oppidani) of some of his castella, laid waste a part of the pagus of Rouen that was possessed by the Northmen on this side of the Seine. Villae were burned, animals were carried away and some of the Northmen were killed. Meanwhile, because little fodder was available for their horses, Count Heribert [of Vermandois] and a few of the Franks remained on the Oise in order to deny a crossing to the Northmen. When the Northmen learned of the devastation of their land, they rushed back home.

	Finally Henry [king of Germany] crossed the Rhine and took by storm the oppidum of Ziilpich, which was defended by Gislebert's jideles. Henry did not remain log in Lothair's Kingdom, but after taking hostages from Gislebert he returned home across the Rhine. Count Hilgaudus [II of Pontheiu] and other Franks who lived along the sea coast invaded and devastated areas bordering on their own lands that the Northmen had recently come to possess.

	Meanwhile, [King] Raoul left Burgundy and came to Francia in order to prepare for war against the Northmen, and he issued a call to arms to the Franks. Therefore, when the expedition against the Northmen had begun, Heribert [of Vermandois], with the soldiers of the church of Reims, Count Arnulf and other Franks from along the sea coast attacked a praesidium of the Northmen. In response, their princeps Rollo sent 1,000 Northmen from Rouen, in addition to the men of that oppidum. This castrum, which is located near the sea, is called Eu. The Franks surrounded it, breaching the encircling outer wall, and broke down and climbed the inner wall. They took possession of the oppidum, killed all the horses and burned the munitio. A few of the defenders escaped and took up a position on an island nearby Eu. The Franks attacked and seized the island, which took longer than their capture of the oppidum [of Eu]. Some of the Northmen who had been fighting for their lies finally gave up and jumped into the water in order to swim to safety but were drowned. Others died by the swords of the Franks while still others killed themselves with their own spears. When all the Northmen were thuse dead and much booty had been captured, the Franks returned home.

	However King Raoul, along with Hugh [the Great] and the Burgan-dians, established his court in the pagus of Beauvais. At this same time, Archbishop Seulfus of Reims died, having completed three years and five days of his episcopal office. Count Heribert [of Vermandois] came to Reims and saw to it that both the vassals (passali) and the clergy of this church respected his advice concerning the election of an archbishop.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flodoard
	Following Seulf's death in 925, the magnate Herbert II, Count of Vermandois installed his five-year-old son, Hugh, as the new archbishop. Flodoard refused to participate in the young boy's election, and was stripped of his position and benefices.[2]

	Hugh [the Great], son of Robert, made a pact of security with the Northmen, but the lands of the sons Baldwin, and those of Raoul de Gouy and Hilgaundus [count of Ponthieu] were excluded from the agreement.

	The diocese of Reims was committed to Count Heribert [of Vermandois], who managed it from his son Hugh, a small boy, it was said, not yet five years of age. Bishop Abbo [of Soissons] went to Rome with envoys from Count Heribert. All the Lotharingians committed themselves to Henry [king of Germany], who then conceded the diocese of Verdun to Berniunus, the nephew of Bishop Dado [of Verdun]. Bernuinus was ordained bishop there after the priest Hugh, to whom [King] Raoul had given the diocese, was expelled.

	8.

	When the year 926 began, King Raoul, Count Heribert [of Vermandois] and some of the Franks who lived along the sea coast besieged the Northmen in the pagus of Arras, who were crowded together in a forest. After several days, the Northmen suddenly attacked the king's camp at night. Count Heribert came to the assistance of the king lest Raoul should be captured by the Northmen and there was fighting at the encampment, with some huts there being burned. The Northmen were repulsed by an attack from the [king's] camp and they retreated, although the king was wounded and Count Hilgauds [of Ponthieu] was killed. It is said that 1,100 Northmen died in that battle. Raoul then returned to Laon, and the Northmen plundered the forest region as far as the pagus of Porcien.

	Moreover, the Magyars crossed the Rhine and raged as far as the pagus of Voncq, taking booty and setting fires. There was an eclipse of the moon, its fourteenth day, on 1 April, the Saturday of Easter, and it became pale, with just a little light remaining, just like a two-day old moon. As dawn broke, the entire moon became the color of blood. For fear of the Mgyars the body of St-Remi and the relics of other saints were taken from their monasteries and brought to Reims, to be placed among the relics of Saint Wllburgis, and many miracles were performed there.

	A tax of money was collected publicly through Francia and Burgundy and was given to the Northmen, in accordance with a [new] peace treaty. Thus, after the money had been handed over, the peace was confirmed by a [mutual] oath. Thereupon the army of King Raoul and Counter Heribert [of Vermandois] marched out from Francia and Burgundy across the Lour and recieved hostges from the urbs of Nevers, which was being defended agaisnt the king by the brother of [Duke] William [of Aquitaine]. The army then crossed into Aquitaine in pursuit of William, who had deserted from the king, and it pursued him until ther was news that the Magyars had crossed the Rhine, which forced the army back to Francia.

	...The priest Hugh was expelled from Verdun and died. Ebrardus, who came from across the Rhine, was sent into Lothair's Kingdom by Henry [king of Germany] in order to do justice, and he was able to unite in peace the Lotharingians [who were fighting among themselves].

	9.

	In 927, a conflict arose between King Raoul and Count Heribert [of Vermandois]. Heribert had asked that his son Odo be given the county of Laon but the king conceded it to Roger, one of the sons of Roger. At Reims in the month of March on a Sunday morning, a line of fire was seen in the sky. Following that sign a plague came, with fever and a cough in a mixed pestilence, which stole into all the peoples of Germany and Gaul. Bishop Widri-cus of Metz died. Count Heribert sent his legates across the Rhine to Henry [king of Germany]. When they returned, they summoned Heribert to a meeting with [King] Henry. Heribert, along with Hugh [the Great], the son of Robert, hurried to the meeting and peace was made. Heribert and [King] Henry gave the diocese of Metz to Benno, God's servant, despite an election [of another] by the people of Metz.

	Hugh [the Great], the son of Robert, and Count Heribert [of Ver-mandois] proceded agains the Northmen who were staying on the Loire. A great storm struck the pagus of Laon and Soissons, which blew down many trees and houses and killed many people in various places. William, the princeps of the Aquitanians, died. The Northmen of the Loir were besiged for five weeks by Heribert and Hugh [the Great]. After hostages were offered and accepted and the pagus of Nantes was conceded to them, the Northmen agreed to a peace with the Franks.

	A synod of six bishops was held at Trosly-Loire, but King Raoul prohibited the meeting through the envoys of Count Heribert and ordered Heribert to postpone the synod and to meet him at Compiegne. Heribert refused to do this and attended the synod. Count Erluinus [of Montreuil] came to the synod to do penance for marring whil he wife was still living. After the synod adjourned, Count Heribet wanted to enter Laon, but King Raoul sent soldiers who prevented Heribert's guardianship of the plae. King Raoul followed and entered the castellum [of Laon]. Heribert then freed [King] Charles from custody and took him to St-Quentin in the pagus of Vermandois. Raoul returned to Burgundy after leaving Laon in the hands of his wife [Emma] and the sons of Roger [count of Laon]. The sons then left the area around Coucy-le-Chateau, a castrum of the diocese of Reims, which they were devestating. [King] Charles and [Count] Heribert sought a meeting with the Northmen at castellum of Eu, and there Rollo's son [William Longsword] committed himself to [King] Charles and affirmed his friendship with Heribert. Fears resulting from a false rumor of [an invasion by] the Magyars led people to take flight throughout the Lotharingian kingdom and Francia.

	10.

	At the beginning of 928, during the period of the liturgies of the birth of Christ, [King] Raoul came from Burgundy with an invading force of Burgundians in order to plunder and burn certain places. Hugh [the Great], son of Robert, hurried to meet the king on the river Oise in the role of a mediator and a trustee between King Raoul and Count Heribert. Hugh took hostages from Heribert until they should meet again at a mutually agreeable placitum. Raoul then returned to Burgundy but was unable to persuade his wife [Emma] to leave Laon. Count Heribert came to Reims with [King] Charles and then sent a letter to Pope John [X] in Rome, informing him of the restoration and status (honor) of Charles and hoping that the pope might order [the Franks], under the threat of excommunication, to use their power on [King] Charles's behalf. King Raoul and Count Heribert met again at a placitum during Lent. The queen, that is, Raouls wife [Emma], gave up Laon and returned to Burgundy. Count Heribert then took posession of Laon and held a placitum with the Northmen, and he and Hugh [the Great], the son of Robert, made friendship with them. However, Odo, the son of Heribert [of Vermandois], whom Rollo was holding as a hostage, was not returned to his father until Heribert and certain other counts and bishops of Francia committed themselves to [King] Charles.

	Different storms struck various places. Bishop Otgarius of Aimens died; he was a holy man and had lived to old age, being more than a hundred years old. Count Heribert [of Vermandois] took by storm the Mortagne-du-Nord on the river Scheldt, which belonged to the sons of Roger [of Laon], and destroyed it. In the meantime, the envoy of Count Heribert returned from Rome, bringing news that Pope John [X] had been imprisoned by Guy, the brother of King Hugh [of Italy], because of a feud between the two. Bishop Odalricus of Aix-en-Provence was brought into the church of Reims by Count Heribert in order to perform the office of bishop on behalf of Hugh, Heribert's son, who was still only a boy. [In compensation] the abbacy of St-Timothee was conceded to Bishop Odalricus, along with a canon's prebend.

	[King] Henry, the princeps of Germany, crossed the Rhine with a large forces of Germans and arrived on the Meuse, where he besieged Count Boso's castrum of Durofostum. This was because Boso was refusing to come to justice for certain abbeys and lands of the dioceses [of Verdun and Metz], which he had taken by the authority of his power and obstinately held despite Henry's commands. Henry sent a message to Boso, pledging him peace to him if he should come to the king. After Boso recieved hostages from the king in a pact of security, he came to Henry and made an oath promising fidelity and peace to him within the kingdom. Boso then returned the lands that he had forcibly seized, receiving back in compensation various holdings. Then Boso and Ragenarius were reconciled with Gislebert and other Lotharingins.

	Hugh [the Great] and Heribert [of Vermandois] set out for a conference with Henry [king of Germany]. After they returned, they continued on to meet with King Raoul. Again Heribert committed himself to Raoul and once again [King] Charles was put into custody. Finally, Heribert set out for Burgundy, along with Raoul, to meet Hugh, the king of Italy. The grape harvest was almost completed within the month of August. King Hugh [of Italy] had a conference with [King] Raoul and gave the provinence of Vienne to Count Heribert, in the place of Hugh's own son Odo. Bishop Benno of Metz was the victim of a plot and was castrated and blinded. King Raoul came to Reims and made peace with Charles, returning Attigny to him and honoring him with gifts.

	11.

	In the year 929, Count Heribert [of Vermandois] and Count Hugh [the Great] set out against [King] Raoul's brother Boso, who had seized certain allods of the recently deceased Rothildis, Hugh's mother-in-law, which Hugh wanted back. Counter Heribert took Boso's castellum of Vitry-en-Perthois and then both Hugh and Heribert granted Boso a truce to last until the end of the month of May. Boso went to [King] Henry and was compelled publicly to sear to peace.

	...Pope John [X] was deprived of his primacy (prindpatus) by Marozia, a very powerful woman, and he was murdered while he was a captive. Some maintain that he was strangled.

	King Charles died at Peronne. A dispute arose between Count Hugh [the Great] and Count Heribert [of Vermandois] when Erlunius was received, along with his lands, by Hugh and when Hilduinus, who was Hugh's man, was recieved by Heribert.

	The Saracens blocked the Apline paths and turned back many who wished to travel to Rome.

	12.

	In the year 930, the Northmen of the Loir were attacking Aquitaine with plundering expeditions, but King Raoul almost annihilated them in a single battle at the pagus of Limoges. The king then made the Aquitanians submit themselves to him. Heribert [of Vermandois] received Arnold [count of Douai], who had been the man of Hugh [the Great]. Hugh [the Great] and Heribert [of Vermandois] conducted various military operations against each other through Francia. King Raoul came into Francia and by great effort in a number of placita he made peace between Hugh, Heribert, and [King Raoul's brother] Boso. Heribert then returned Vitry-en-Perthois to Boso. When Bishop Adelmus of Laon died, he was succeeded by his nephew (nepos) Gosbert. Heribert recieved Ansellus, the vassal (vassalus) of Boso, and the castellum of Vitry-en-Perthois that Ansellus was holding. Heribert then gave to Ansellus Coucy-le-Chateau and other lands.

	When King Raoul returned to Burgundy, Gislebert and the Lotharingians came into Francia and met Hugh [the Great]. They besied and captured the oppidum of Douai, which [Count] Arnold was holding. In the meantime Boso's men recaptured Vitry-en-Perthois through treachery and took Mouzon by a trick. Boso left some of his fideles as a garrison to guard Mouzon and himself set out to the siege of the aforesaid castrum [of Vitry]. However, Heribert [of Vermandois] was summoned by the inhabitants of Mouzon and he arrived there without being detected by corssing the Meuse by fords that he found. He entered the oppidum through a gate that the garrison {castellani} had secretly left open for him and captured all of Boso's vassals (vassali) whom he had left there to defend Mouzon.

	At Reims, below and around the church of Stain Mary, a great light appeared in the northern and eastern parts of the sky shortly before daybreak.

	13.

	In the year 931, King Raoul set out for Vienne to meet with Charles Constantine [the count of Vienne], the son of Lous the Blind, who was holding it. Charles Constantine promised to submit to Raoul and the king returned [to Burgundy]. He then set out for Tours to pray at [the monastery of] Saint Martin. In the meantime, the Lotharingians captured Doua and Hugh [the Great] conceded it to Rogher, the son of Roger [of Laon]. Indeed, in return Heribert [of Vermandois] restored the castrum of St-Quentin to Arnold [of Douai].

	...Gislebert, the son of Manasses, withdrew his allegience from King Raoul because Queen Emma had taken away from him the castrum of Avvalon. Likewise Richard, the son of Warnerius, defected for the same reason. Similarly, a conflict arose between Gislebert the Lotharingian and Boso [the brother of King Raoul], and Boso made a peace pact with Heribert [of Vermandois]. Boso's castrum of Durofostum was captured by Gislebert, and at the same time the munitio of Mortagne-due-Nord which belonged to the sons of Roger [of Laon], was taken by Arnulf, Baldwin's son. Heribert accepted the friendship of Gislebert the Lotharingian. Boso, having renounced his allegience to Henry [king of Germany], went to King Raoul. Boso then returned to the castrum of Chalons-sur-Marne and captured it by force. He then set it on fire and destroyed it. There was due to the hostility of Bishop Bovo of Calons, whose men had lopped off limbs of some of Boso's men. King Raoul retruned to Francia. Because Count Heribert had deserted from him, the king and Hugh [the Great] captured and destroyed Heribert's castellum of Denain. Next the king besieged Arras. Count Heribert, who was joined by the Lotharingians due to the efforts of Duke Gislebert, advanced against the king. However, both sides departed after agreeing to a truce that was to last until the first day of October.

	Meanwhile, some of Heribert's fideles lef the urbs of Reims and captured and destroyed the castrum of Braisne, on the river Vesle. Earlier, Hugh [the Great] had taken his place from [Gontard] the [arch]biship of Rouen. King Raoul sent a letter to the clergy and the people of Reims for them to have an election of a bishop. They answered the king that they could not do this, for they had already chosen a bishop who was well and their election stood. Count Heribert went to Henry [king of Germany] and committed himself to him. An army of King [Raul] and of Hugh [the Great] pillaged Laon and the pagus of Reims. King Raul proceeded on to Attigny and sent Hugh to [King] Henry, and [King] Henry returned across the Rhine after receiving hostages and a pact of security from Hugh.

	In the meantime, on the solemnities of Saint Michael [29 September] the Bretons who had remained subdued by the Northmen in Cournouaille rose up against those who were holding them in their power. It was said that they killed all the Northmen who were found among them, and the first who died was their commander {dux}, Felecan.

	King Raoul and Hugh [the Great], Boso and other of his men besieged the urbs of Reims. After the siege had lasted for three weeks, those who were in the civitas opened it to the besiegers. Raoul entered the city and had ordained as bishop there Artoldus, a monk from the monastery of St-Remi who earlier this year had deserted Heribert and gone over to Hugh. The king also caputred Bishop Bovo of Chalons, who had deserted from Raoul along with Heribert. He placed Bovo into Hugh's custody and handed the bishopric of Chalons, over to the cleric Milo. The king continued on to Laon and laid seige to Heribert, who had immured himself and his men there. Heribert did not hold out for very long but was allowed to leave Laon after despatching his wife to hold the citadel that he had constructed inside the city. King Raoul was unable to take the citadel after immense effort and considerable delay. After this, Raoul returned to Burgundy and set out to meet the rebellious Aquitanians. The Northman Incon, who was staying on the Loire, invaded Brittany with his men. He gained posession of the region after defeating, plundering, killing and expelling the Bretons.

	14.

	In the year 932, King Raoul returned to Burgundy and recaptured some castella that belonged to Gislebert and Richard, who had deserted him. Bishop Airadus of Noyon died and one of the clerics of this urbs who wanted to become bishop allowed count Adelelmus [of Arras] to climb the wall of the dvitas in secret at night. In the morning the count drove out the soldiers from the urbs, but they collected some men from the suburbs and attacked the dvitas. Those inside the walls counterattacked, nonetheless some entered by a burned gate and others through a church window. Adelelmus fled into the church and was killed next to the altar along with others who had enetered with him. THus the townsmen (dves) of Noyon regained the urbs.

	After Count Heribert [of Vermandois] received the surrender of the castrum of Ham, he captured Erbardus, the brother of Erluinus [the count of Montreuil and Ponthieu], who had been holding it. King Raoul conferred with Hugh [the Great] and recieved Bishop Bovo into his favor and returned to him the bishopric of Chalons. Abbot Waltbert of Corbie was ordained bishop of Noyon. King Raoul recieved Gislebert [of Chalon] and left Burgundy for Francia, where he gained posession of the abbey of St-Medard [of Soissons], previously held by Heribert [of Vermandois], and then he returned to Burgundy.

	Hugh [the Great] and some bishops of Francia laid siege to the dvitas of Amiens, which was being held by Heribert's fideles. He attacked repeatedly and finally withdrew when many hostages had been ofered to him. He then moved on the surround the castrum of St-Quentin and palce it under siege. Milo pillaged the diocese of Chalons and was excommunicated by Archbishop Artoldus [of Reims] and the other bishops of the province of Reims. After a seige of two months Hugh captured the castellum of St-Quentin when the garrison (oppidani) surrendered. On the day after he entered St-Quentin, a man who had been crippled was cured in the church.

	[The count of Toulouse,] Raymond[-Pons III] and Ermingaudus [count of Rouergue], prindpes of Gothia, committed themselves to King Raoul, as did Lupus Acinarius the Gascon, who was said to have a horse that was more than a hundred years old yet was still very strong. [Duke] Gislebert, at the invitation of Hugh [the Great], besieged Peronne with the Lotharingians. Many Lotharingians died in the frequent encounters and the remaining Lotharingians, unable to take the minitio, withdrew after Hugh mediated a conference between Duke Gislebert and King Raoul. King Raul and Hugh [the Great] placed under seige Heribert's castellum of Ham. After recieving hostages they raised the siege. Bishop Gosbert of Laon died, and Ingoramnus, the dean of the monestary of St-Medard [of Soissons] was ordained bishop of Laon. Boso, the king's brother, and Bishop Bernuinus of Verdun made an orgy (bacchantur) with fires and raids. Heribert [of Verman-dois] set out across the Rhine to Henrgy [king of Germany].

	15.

	In the year 933, Giso and Amalricus, envoys of the church of Reims, returned from Rome and brought the pallim to [Arch]bishop Artoldus, They reported that Pope John [XI], the son of Mary, also called Marozia, was held in custody by his brother Alberic. Alberic also kept his mother Marozia under confinement and held Rome agaisnt King Hugh [of Italy]. The Magyars divided their forces into three units. One of them went to Italy and another invaded the lands of Henry [King of Germany] across the Rhine. Henry set out against them, along with the Bavarians and Saxons and other peoples who were subject to him. He cut down all of them, almost exterminating them. It is said that 36,000 were killed, not including those who drowned in the river or those taken alive.

	Richarius, the bishop of Tongres, demolished a castellum of Count Bernard, which the count had built at Charleville in the pagus of Porcien. This was because it was located on lands belonging to his church. The men who held Vienne handed it over to King Raoul. William [Longsword], the princeps of the Northmen, committed himself to the king [Raoul], who then gave William the land of the Bretons that was located along the sea coast. For six weeks King Raoul besieged Chateau-Thierry, a munitio of Heribert. Afterwards, Walo, who had held it, committed himself to Queen Emma and the castrum was given to her faith and care.

	...Heribert [of Vermandois] son Odo, who was holding the praesidium of Ham, raided throughout the pagus of Soissons and Noyon, looting and burning as he went. His father Heribert came in secret to Sq-Quentin and on the third day took the castrum by fighting. THe residents of the place (oppidani) did not put up a resistance, but only the garrison (custodes) placed there by Hugh [the Great]. Heribert captured the garrison and then released them after they gave him oaths [not to fight again]. He then left his own supporters there to hold the oppidum. When Hugh [the Great] heard what had happened, he came quickly to St-Quentin and took it. He captured a certain noble cleric named Treduinus, who had been sent there by Heribert, and hanged him along with others. He also mutilated many others by cutting off various limbs.

	He then set out with Lord [Arch]bishop Artoldus and easily captured the munitio of Roye when Heribert's garrison handed it over to him.

	...Heribert [of Vermandois] recieved Chateau-Thierry located on the Marne, when the garrison that Walo had left there handed it over. Heribert put his own men there to guard it and departed. When Hugh [the Great] heard this, he carefully laid siege to the same castrum as quickly as possible.

	16.

	In the year 934, King Raoul and Count Hugh [the Great] laid seige to the aforesaid munitio [of Chateau-Thierry]. In the fourth month of the siege, at night when the garrison (custodes) was sleeping, Walo and his men climbed the walls and captured a part of the oppidum. However, the better prepared citadel was still held by Heribert's fideles. Not longer after this, at the urging of the royal soldiers, they gave hostages and Walo broke off the siege.

	At Reims, in the church of Mary the Blessed Mother of God, on the feast of Annunciation of the Lord [25 March], [Arch]bishop Artoldus was celebrating masses there. Then a certain young man, who was accustomed to crawl because the tendons of his kneews were drawn up, suddenly stood up as his joins were loosened and his legs straightened out, and he walked again on the feet that had been forgotton so long.

	...King Raoul and Hugh [the Great] resumed the siege [of Chateau-Thierry], when the hostages that they had given Heribert [of Vermandois] had been neglected.

	Henry [king of Germany] sent [Duke] Gislebert [of Lotharingia] and [Count] Ebrardus [of Franconia], along with the bishops of Lothair's Kingdom, to King Raoul on behalf of Heribert. Chateau-Thierry was returned to the king and Ham and Peronne were conceded to Heribert until 1 October. Arnulf [I, the Old] of Flanders took as his wife Heribert's daughter [Adele], to whom he had already been betrothed through an exchange of oaths. Heribert gathered the harvests throughout the pagus of Vermandois from those who had abandoned the land that Hugh [the Great] had given them, which he had taken to Peronne.

	At Reims, just before the break of day on 14 October, a line of fire was seen in the sky running in different directions, just like a serpent of fire, and iron javelins were also seen in the sky. A plague followed soon after this afflicting humans with various aliments. Adelmarus, a deacon of Verdun, fell ill and was seen to have let go of his spirit. However, before he was placed on a bier, he returned and rose so healthy that no traces of the illness remained. He testified that he had seen various places of prayer and of refreshment, and he was condemned to a place of punishment. But by the prayers of the Mother of God and by the intercession of Blessed Martin, he had been returned to his present life in order to do penance.

	Gislebert and the Lotharingians came into Francia to assist Heribert [of Vermandois], who was about to besiege the oppidum of St-Quentin. However, before he had reached it, envoys of Hugh [the Great] came and met with him, and when oaths were given on both sides, they made peace between Hugh [the Great] and Heribert [of Vermandois] that was to last until the month of May. The Lotharingians then returned home.

	The religion of the rule of monks was restored in certain monasteries throughout Lothair's Kingdom. Queen Emma died.

	17.

	In the year 935, King Raoul besieged and captured the castrum of Vitry which belonged to Geoffrey [count of Nevers] and which certain Aquitainians were holding against him. The king then returned it to Geoffrey and moved into Francia, sending Geoffrey across the Rhine to meet with Henry [king of Germany]. On the holy day of Easter [29 March], while King Raoul was residing at Laon, there was a clash between the king's soldiers and those of the bishop [Ingoramnus], during which many of the laity as well as clergy were wounded or killed. After this, the king held a placitum at Soissons with the magnates (primates) of the kingdom. Aftewards, the king spoke with Henry's envoys and hurried to a meeting with him, where Rudolf [II], the king of the Jura [Upper Burgundy], was also present. A pact of friendship was made between them and they even arranged a reconciliation between Heribert and Hugh, with certain of Heribert's posessions being returned to him. [King] Henry recieved Boso and restored to him most of the land he had previously held [in the Lotharingian kingdom].

	The Magyars attacked throughout Burgundy, raging with plunderings, fires, and murder. However, this raiding lasted for only a short time, for when teh Magyars learned of King Raoul's coming, they moved on into Italy. Archbishop Artoldus [of Reims] ordained the monk Wicredus as bishop of the church of Therouanne.

	King Raoul besieged the castrum of Dijon, which Count Boso [brother of King Raoul] had captured and which his accomplices were holding. The Lotharingians, along with some counts from Saxony who were Heribert's friends, along with a large army, came to a kind of meeting with Hugh [the Great]. But because Hugh refused to return the castellum of St-Quentin to Heribert, they besieged that munitio, which they attacked vigorously and, when the garrison (tutantes) surrendered, they captured it. They then made the fortifications indefensible, They were prepairing to besiege Laon but returned into their own lands at the command of King Raoul.

	In the meantime King Raoul's brother Boso died on an expedition to besiege the castrum of St-Quentin. He was take to [the monastery of] St-Remi and buried there. King Raoul lay seriously ill throughout the entire autumn. The Northmen who had plundered the pagus of Bourges were destroyed in battle by the men of Berry and the Touraine. Lord Archbishop Artoldus presided over a synod of seven bishops at Ste-Macre. At this synod those who had robbed and besieged the lands of the church were summoned to correct their deeds.

	18.

	In the year 936, Ingramnus, the bishop of the church of Laon, died. On almost the same day King Raoul died and was buried at the church of Saint Columba at Sens, which had been burned by a faction of men a little before. The Bretons from across the sea, with the support of King Aethelstan [of the English], returned and took back their land. Count Hugh [the Great] sent across the sea [to England] and summoned Louis, the son of Charles [the Simple], to take up the rule of the kingdom [of Francia]. Louis's uncle, king Aethelstan, sent him to Francia along with bishops and others of his jideles after oaths had been given by the legates of the Franks. Hugh and the rest of the nobles (proceres) of the Franks sent out to meet Louis when he left eh ship, and they committed themselves to him on the beach at Boulogne-sur-Mer just as both sides had previously agreed. They then conducted Louis to Laon and he was consecreated king, annointed and crowned by Lord Archbishop Artoldus [of Reims], in the presence of the principes of the kingdom and more than twenty bishops.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_IV_of_France
	Louis IV (September 920 / September 921[1] – 10 September 954), called d'Outremer or Transmarinus (both meaning "from overseas"), reigned as king of West Francia from 936 to 954. A member of the Carolingian dynasty, he was the only son of king Charles the Simple and Eadgifu of Wessex, daughter of King Edward the Elder of Wessex.[2] His reign is mostly known thanks to the Annals of Flodoard and the later Historiae of Richerus.

	...After the dethronement and capture of Charles the Simple in 923, queen Eadgifu and her infant son took refuge in Wessex (for this he received the nickname of d'Outremer) at the court of her father King Edward, and after Edward's death, of her brother King Æthelstan. Young Louis was raised in the Anglo-Saxon court until his teens. During this time he enjoyed legendary stories about Edmund the Martyr, King of East Anglia, an ancestor of his maternal family who had heroically fought against the Vikings.[3]

	...Louis became the heir to the western branch of the Carolingian dynasty after the death of his captive father in 929, and in 936 was recalled from Wessex by the powerful Hugh the Great, Margrave of Neustria, to succeed the Robertian king Rudolph who had died.

	Once he took the throne, Louis wanted to free himself from the tutelage of Hugh the Great, who, with his title of Duke of the Franks was the second most powerful man after the King.

	In 939 the young monarch attempted to conquer Lotharingia; however, the expedition was a failure and his brother-in-law, king Otto I of East Francia counterattacked and besieged the city of Reims in 940. In 945, following the death of William I Longsword, Duke of Normandy, Louis tried to conquer his lands, but was kidnapped by the men of Hugh the Great.

	The bishopric of Laon was given to the priest Raoul, who was from Laon, following his peaceful election by the townsmen (cives). He was consecrated as bishop by Lord [Archbishop] Artoldus. The king and Hugh [the Great] proceeded into Burgundy and laid siege to the urbs of the Langres, which had been seized by Hugh [the Black], King Raoul's brother. Louis and Hugh took the city without fighting when the garrison fled. They then went to Paris after they recieved hostages from the bishops and the magnates (primates) of Burgundy. Because King Henry [of Germany] had died during that time [2 July 936], there arose a conflict over the kingdom among his sons, with the highest position falling to his son Otto, being better by birth.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottonian_dynasty#Otto_I
	Otto I, Duke of Saxony upon the death of his father in 936, was elected king within a few weeks. He continued the work of unifying all of the German tribes into a single kingdom, greatly expanding the powers of the king at the expense of the aristocracy.[1] Through strategic marriages and personal appointments, he installed members of his own family to the kingdom's most important duchies. This, however, did not prevent his relatives from entering into civil war: both Otto's brother Duke Henry of Bavaria and his son Duke Liudolf of Swabia revolted against his rule. Otto was able to suppress their uprisings, in consequence, the various dukes, who had previously been co-equals with the king, were reduced into royal subjects under the king's authority. His decisive victory over the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 ended the Hungarian invasions of Europe and secured his hold over his kingdom.[1][2]

	The defeat of the pagan Magyars earned King Otto the reputation as the savior of Christendom and the epithet "the Great". He transformed the Church in Germany into a kind of proprietary church and major royal power base to which he donated charity and for the creation of which his family was responsible. By 961, Otto had conquered the Kingdom of Italy, which was a troublesome inheritance that none wanted, and extended his kingdom's borders to the north, east, and south. In control of much of central and southern Europe, the patronage of Otto and his immediate successors caused a limited cultural renaissance of the arts and architecture. He confirmed the 754 Donation of Pepin and, with recourse to the concept of translatio imperii in succession of Charlemagne, proceeded to Rome to have himself crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope John XII in 962.

	On 4 September, the fourteenth-day-old-moon [full moon] was covered in the color of blood and scarcely seemed to light up the night. Pope John [XI], brother of the patrician Alberic, died and Leo [VII], a servant of God, was established as pope in Rome. King Hugh of Italy exerted himself to take Rome, but his army was afflicted by a famine and by the loss of its horses. Hugh then made peace with Alberic, giving him his own daughter [Alda] as his wife, and he broke of the siege. But when he learned of some plots against him by the men of his brother Boso, it is said, he captured his brother by a trick and kept him under guard.

	The Saracens raided Alamannia and, as they were returning, they killed many who were traveling to Rome. Hugh [the Great], the son of Robert, made peace with Hugh [the Black], the son of Richard [the Justiciar], and they divided Burgundy between themselves. BIshop Adlelmus of Senlis died.

	19.

	In the year 937, Bernuinus, who was from the monastery of St-Crepin [of Soissons], was ordained bishop of Senlis.

	...King Lous withdrew himself from the management of the princeps Hugh [the Great] and recieved his mother [Eadgifu] at Laon. Hugh made peace with Heribert [of Vermandois], who received the castellum of Chateau-Thierry when Walo opened it to him. Walo became Heribert's man but then Heribert threw him into chains.

	A part of the sky seemed to be burning and afterwards there was an invasion of Francia by the Magyars from that direction, with villae and fields laid waste, houses and bascilias burned, and large number of captives led away. However, although they tried to set fire to many other churches they were not able to do so. They were unable to set fire to the church of Ste-Macre [at Fismes] even though they placed two burning sacks of hay against it. In the church of St-Basle, one of the Magyars tried to climb on the altar, placing his hand on it. But his hand stuck to the stone of the altar and he was not able to free his hand by any means. Finally, other Magyars chipped the stone away around his hand [to which it was still attached], which the pagan (ethnicus) displayed to the astonishment of the others.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_invasions_of_Europe
	In 927, Peter, brother of Pope John X, called on the Magyars to rule Italy.[11] They marched into Rome and imposed large tribute payments on Tuscany and Tarento.[11][14] In 933, a substantial Magyar army appeared in Saxony (the pact with the Saxons having expired) but was defeated by Henry I at Merseburg.[11] Magyar attacks continued against Upper Burgundy (in 935) and against Saxony (in 936).[11] In 937, they raided France as far west as Reims, Lotharingia, Swabia, Franconia, the Duchy of Burgundy[16] and Italy as far as Otranto in the south.[11] They attacked Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire, reaching the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines paid them a “tax” for 15 years.[17] In 938, the Magyars repeatedly attacked Saxony.[11] In 940, they ravaged the region of Rome.[11] In 942, Hungarian raids on Spain, particularly in Catalonia,[18] took place, according to Ibn Hayyan's work.[19] In 947, Bulcsú, a chieftain of Taksony, led a raid into Italy[20] as far as Apulia, and King Berengar II of Italy had to buy peace by paying a large amount of money to him and his followers.

	...936-937

	End of 936 – The Hungarians, with the aim to force the new German king, Otto I, to pay them tribute, attack Swabia and Franconia, and burn the Fulda monastery. They then enter Saxony, but the new king's forces repel them towards Lotharingia and West Francia.
	February 21, 937 – They enter Lotharingia, crossing the Rhine at Worms, and advance towards Namur.
	The Hungarians occupy the Abbey of Saint Basolus from Verzy, which they use as headquarters. They then send plundering units to attack the abbeys from Orbay, Saint Macra from Fîmes, the city of Bouvancourt.
	March 24 – They reach the city of Sens, where they burn the Abbey of Saint Peter.
	At Orléans they fight a French army led by count Ebbes de Déols, who is wounded in the battle and dies afterwards. After this, the Hungarians, following the course of the Loire, cross the whole of France until the Atlantic Ocean, then return through the South-East, and on their way to Burgundy, they plunder the surroundings of Bourges.
	After July 11 – The Hungarians enter Burgundy near Dijon, harrying the Monastery of Luxeuil, then they plunder the valley of the Rhône, burn the city of Tournus, occupy the monasteries of Saint Deicolus and Saint Marcell, but fail at the Monastery of Saint Appollinaris.
	August – Continuing their campaign, the Hungarians enter Lombardy from the West, where Hugh of Italy asks them to go to Southern Italy to help the Byzantines. The Hungarians plunder the surroundings of Capua, and install their camp on the meadows of Galliano, and send small units to plunder the regions of Naples, Benevento, Sarno, Nola and Montecassino. The Abbey of Montecassino gives them valuable objects valuing 200 Byzantine hyperpyrons in order to ranslome the captives.[55]

	Adalgarius, a priest of the church of the villa of Bouvaincourt, was captured by the Magyars and taken away into the pagus of Berry. As he was in chains and leg irons, a vision appeared to a woman, a fellow captive, who was ordered to tell the priest that he should escape when he should see that he had been released from his bonds. Just as it was shown in the vision, his shackles were opened. But the priest feared that the barbarian might kill him, as he had often threatened to do if the priest should be captured trying to escape. So the priest, not daring to escape, placed the chains back around his feet, placign back into position the bolt on the chains. On the next night the same vision came to the same female captive, who encouraged the priest to take flight, and again his chains were loosened. At last, the priest made his escape and lay in a marsh for a few days until he learned that the barbarians had left. He then returned to his own fatherland and related to us what he, as a captive, had seen concerning Hucbaldus, a monk of the monastery of Orbais[-l'Abbaye]. The pagans tried to kill him many times, but they were unable to cut into his flesh. Therefore they said that he was a god. The priest reported that a certain man saw Hucbaldus standing naked in the middle of a crowd that was shooting arrows at him from all sides but his skin was not penetrated at all. The arrows simply bounced off his body as if from steel without leaving any trace of a wound on his skin. The man also saw that defenseless Hucbaldus being attacked with a sword that was being wielded vigorously, yet his flesh remained unharmed.

	After a long exile, The Bretons returned to their places and fought many battles against the Northmen, who had invaded that land which was next to their own. The Bretons won many of the encounters and took over the places that the Northman had invaded.

	...20.

	In the year 938, King Louis took by force the castrum of Montigny-Lengrain, which Serlus, who had been acting as a brigand, had been holding. King Louis spared the life of Serlus at the request of Archbishop Artoldus pof Reims], but he destroyed the oppidum. Louis received Heribert [of Verman-dois] in peace at the request of Hugh [the Great]. Louis's father [King Charles the Simple] had given Tusey on the Meuse and other villae pertaining to it to Louis's mother [Eadgif] as a dowry, but Count Roger came to hold them. King Louis set out to regain them by military force and was successful. Returning from there, the king captured the castellum of Corbeny which his father had handed over to [the monastery of] St-Remi [at Reims] and which Heribert [of Vermandois] ahd invaded. The king captured by force what had been committed to him by the monks and, at the request of Lord Arcbishop Artoldus [of Reims], he allowed Heribert's men who were in it to depart. The princeps Hugh [the Great], son of Robert, married [Hadwig] the sister of Otto, the Transrhenine king, and thus the daughter of [King] Henry. King Louis went to the sea coast and worked to restore the castrum of portus of Guines. While he delayed there with Arnulf [count of Flanders], Heribert's men captured the castrum of Chausot, on the Marne, which belonged to the church of Reims and which had been constructed by [Arch]bishop Artoldus. Wipertus betrayed the place and Heribert's men took as their prisoner Ragebertus, the commander of the castrum, whom they lad away with them as they plundered the villae of the area with frequent raids.

	Meanwhile, King Louis had been summoned [to Reims] by Archbishop Artoldus and then returned and entered Laon, laying seige to the new citadel that Heribert [of Vermandois] had built. The wall was undermined and broken by many machines and the citadel was taken by great effort. The king set out to meet with Hugh [the Black, duke of Burgundy], the brother of the late king Raoul, leaving the defense of Laon to Odo, son of Heribert, who had just committed himself to Louis. Hugh [the Black] came to the king and made an oath promising friendship to Louis. [Duke] Gislebert and the Lotharingians came to Hugh [the Great] and Heribert to assist them against King Louis, and they captured by force the castrum of Pierrepont. Count Arnulf [of Flanders] and Heribert agreed to an adjournment with King Louis and Hugh [the Black] and by an oath they arranged a peace to last until the end of the month of January. King Louis took the counsel of Odoinus and Gerardus, who had abandoned Bishop Raoul [II] of Laon and had gone over the Hugh [the Great], and without delay the king plundered and disperesed the treasures found in Laon.

	21.

	In the year 939, King Louis set out to meet Hugh [the Black], son of Richard, and returned with him from Burgundy. He then attacked Hugh [the Great], son of Robert, and William [Longsword], the princeps of the Northmen. William had been excommunicated by the bishops who had been with the king because he had recently ravaged with raids and fire some villae belonging to Count Arnulf [of Flanders]. Heribert [of Vermandois] had also been excommunicated for obstinately holding certain oppida and for usurping villae of [the monastery of] St-Remi. Hugh gave hostages to the king and made a peace with him that was to last until the first day of June.

	The Lotharingians deserted their king Otto and came to King Louis, who delayed receiving them because of the firm friendship between the two kings, which had been arranged by he legates of this Otto [I, king of Germany] and of Count Arnulf [of Flanders]. Count Arnulf captured the coastal castellum of Montreuil, which belonged to Erluinus [count of Montreuil and Ponthieu], when a traitor handed it over to him. Arnulf [captured] Erluinus's wife and children and sent them across the sea to King Aethelstan [of the English]. Not long afterwards, Erluinus, aided by a large force of Northmen, recaptured the castrum by force. He killed some of Arnulf's soldiers whom he found inside, but he spared the lives of others [in order to exchange them] so that he might regain his wife.

	Likewise the Lotharingians came to King Louis and the magnates (proceres) of the Lotharingian kingdom, namely Duke Gislebert and the counts Otho [of Verdun], Isaac [of Cambrai] and Theoderic [of Holland], and committed themselves to Louis. However, the bishops delayed committing themselves to the King Louis because King Otto was holding their hostages with him. King Otto crossed the Rhine and passed through the Lotharingian kingdom, devastating many places by fire and pillaging.

	The fleet of the English was sent by their king Aethelstan to assist King Louis, but when they crossed the sea, they plundered the coast of Flanders. Without accomplishing anything of their original mission, they went back across the sea from where they had come. King Otto held a meeting with Hugh [the Great], Heribert [of Vermandois], Arnulf [of Flanders] and William, the princeps of the NOrthmen. He made a pact with them that was supported by an oath and then returned across the Rhine.

	Meanwhile, King Louis set out for the pagus of Verdun where some bishops of Lothair's Kingdom became his men. From there he left for the pagus of Alsace and spoke with the Cisalpine Hugh [the Black]. He also recieved some Lotharingians who came to meet him. Among these were many of King Otto's fideles who were fleeing across the Rhine. In addition, he evicted Bishop Raoul [II] of Laon, who was accused of treachery, from the castrum [of Laon] and he deprived the bishop's men of the properties of this diocese and gave them to his own men.

	Duke Gislebert of the Lotharingians set out raiding across the Rhine and was returning with the Saxons in pursuit. He jumped into the Rhine with his horse and was killed by the force of the water. His body was never found but it was said that fishermen discovered the corpse of a man, which was buried and concealed because of his equipment.

	King Louis returned to the Lotharingian kingdom and married Ger-berga, the widow of Giselbert, that is, the sister of King Otto. A group of people from various places who were journeying to Rome were siezed and killed by Saracens. The Bretons fought against the Northmen and gained the victory. It was said that they captured a certain castellum of the Northmen. Some men of Arnulf [of Flanders] plundered the lands of Erluinus [count of Mon-treuil and Ponthieu], who killed them. King Otto returned into the Lotharingian kingdom and forced almost all of the Lotharingians to return to him. Hugh the White [the Great] set out to his meeting with Heribert [of Vermandois], and as they returned they plundered some places of the fideles of the church of Reims, many of which they then burned.

	22.

	In the year 940, King Louis went to a meeting with William [Longsword], the princeps of the Northmen, who met him in the pagus of AImiens and committed himself to the king. Louis gave William the land that his father [King] Charles had conceded to the Northmen and then set out against Hugh [the Great]. But when Hugh refused to meet him, Louis returned to Laon. However, the king, through a written royal order, gave in perpetuitiy to Archbishop Artoldus and thus the church of Reims the mint of the urbs of Reims. But he conferred the entire county of Reims to the same church. Archbishop Artoldus then laid seige to the minitio of Chausot and on the fifth day, after King Louis had arrived there, the defenders surrendered and deserted. A short time later the place was undermined and thus completely destroyed by those who had taken it.

	Envoys sent by Hugh [the Great] came to King Louis, who was eager to establish peace between them on one side and [Arch]bishop Artoldus [of Reims] and Heribert [of Vermandois] on the other. THe king then set out with BIshop Artoldus to the castrum on the Marne [Chatillion-sur-Marne], which Heriveus, the nephew (nepos) of the former bishop Heriveus, was holding. From that place he had been pillaging nearby villae belonging to the diocese of Reims. The king quickly returned to Reims after receiving hostages from this Heriveus. On the next day, he went to [the monastery of] St-Remi and committed himself to the intercessions of the saint, promising that he would give a pound of silver every year for the fording of the river. He also gave the monks of St-Remi a precept of immunity for the same castellum.

	The princeps Hugh [the Great], Robert's son, when certain bishops of both Francia and Burgundy had joined with him, besieged the urbs of Reims, along with Count Heribert [of Vermandois] and William [Longsword], the princeps of the Northmen. On the sixth day of the siege, when almost the entire force of soldiers deserted Archbishop Artoldus and joined Heribert, the same Heribert entered the urbs. Bishops Artoldus, who had sent out to [the monastery of] St-Remi at the summons of the magnates (proceres) and bishops, was terrified by the prindpes [Heribert and William] and was persuaded to abdicate from the office and power of his see. The abbatia of St-Basle was conceded to him and he withdrew to the monastery of Avenay to stay at St-Basle. Hugh and Heribert spoke with certain Lotharingians and set out with William to lay siege to Laon. The deacon Hugh, Heribert's son, who had been called to the episcopacy of this urbs a long time before was left beind at Reims [as bishop].

	After staying in Burgundy for six or seven weeks, King Louis returned, brining with him Archbishop Artoldus with his kinsmen, as well as his companions, whose benefices (beneficia) Count Heribert [of Vermandois] had stolen. The king came to the Champagne pagus of Reims, and when he had crossed the river Aisne he advanced on Laon. When Hugh [the Great] and Heribert learned of this, they gave up the siege of Laon and hurried by night to the munitio of Pierrepont, and [from there] they set out to meet King Otto [of Germany]. After joining him, they conducted him to Attigny and there they, along with count Roger [of Laon], committed themselves to [King] Otto.

	King Louis entered Laon and provided his men with necessary sustenances. Then, along with Hugh the Black [duke of Burgundy] and William [Towhead, count] of Poitou, he returned to Burgundy. King Otto gave [the administration of the] Lotharingian kingdom to his brother Henry [duke of Bavaria]. Then, with a multitude of diverse peoples whom he had gathered with him, Otto set out into Burgundy after King Louis. Otto had with him [King] Conrad [III of Upper Burgundy], son of King Rudolf [II] of Jura, whom he had captured by means of a ruse and whom he kept with him. Otto laid out his fortified encampment on the banks of the Seine and recieved hostages from Hugh the Black, who also swore that he would not harm Hugh [the Great] or Heribert [of Vermandois], who had committed themselves to Otto. When this was completed, Otto returned home. Hugh, son of Heribert [of Vermandois], was ordained priest at Reims by Bishop Guy of Soissons. King Lous returned to Laon.

	Finally, I decided to visit the tomb of Saint Martin [at Tours] so that I might pray there. However, I was detained by Count Heribert [of Vermandois] when some men had made secret accusations against me, that I wanted to set out in order to harm him or his son, and he had me held in custody. He also took from me the things that I was holding from the diocese, along with the church in Cormicy that I administered. THus I was held in custody for five full months. King Louis attacked the munitio of Pierrepont, withdrawing from it after he had recieved hostages. He then set out into the Lotharingian kingdom with Archbishop Artoldus [of Reims] and with others of hid jideles. King Otto crossed the Rhine and came out against him. However, a truce was arranged between them by their jideles.

	A girl named Flotildis, a poor maiden from the villa of Lavannes, was eagerly looking for visions of the saints and was accustomed to see in the spirit and predict the future. In the next year, she died on the night of the Lord's birth.

	In this year, on a Sunday night in the month of December, a line of various colors was seen in the sky.

	...23.

	In the year 941

	...Count Heribert [of Vermandois] called a synod to settle the dispute [over the archbishopric of Reims] between his son Hugh and Archbishop Artoldus. However, Hugh [the Great] obstructed the process and was active to stop it lest those who would attend it should do so far the fidelity and aid of King Louis, and the synod did not meet.

	King Louis set out for Burgundy and learned that Count Roger [of Laon] had by chance laid out his camp close to his own. The king went to the river Marne and captured Count Roger, along with those who were with him, and led them with him into Burgundy.

	The Counts Hugh [the Great] and Heribert [of Vermandois] summoned the bishops of the province of Reims, who then met together at Sois-sons, in the church of Saints Crispin and Crispinianus. They dealt with the status of the diocese of Reims and resolved to do something about it. Clerics and nobles of the laity complained that this see had lacked a pastor for a long time and, because [Arch]bishop Artoldus [of Reims] had swon that he had never meddled in that diocese, it ought to be returned to the administration of Hugh, the son of Count Heribert. Indeed, Hugh, who earlier had been called to this bishopric, was ordained bishop at the request of both clergy and laity. THe first thing that this Hugh did was to command that I be recalled from exile. The bishops then went to Reims so that Hugh, our bishop-elect, could be consecrated bishop at [the monsetary of] St-Remi [at Reims].

	...King Louis set out for Burgundy and made peace between Count Roger [of Laon] on one side and Hugh the Black and [Count] Gislebert on the other. The king then stayed at Laon and drove Arnold [of Doouai] and his brother Landricus, both of whom having been accused of treachery, from Laon's castrum. The king gave the county of Laon to Roger. When King Louis learned that Hugh the White [the Great] had hurried to besiege Laon, Lous again set out for the parts of Burgundy with [Arch]bishop Artoldus and Count Roger. When Louis delayed around the castrum of Vitry-en-Perthois [or le Brule], Hugh [the Great] and Heribert [of Vermandois] laid seige to Laon. However, the king came into the pagus of Porcien with the men whom he was able to collect form anywhere he could. When Hugh and Heribert learned that the king was coming against them, they raised the siege and hurried out against the king, catching Louis's army by surprise and killing many, while others fled. THe king and a few others were barely able to escape. Louis was led away by his own men who forced him to give up the battle.

	[Arch]bishop Artoldus and Counter Roger [of Laon] accompanied the king in flight. [Arch]bishop Artoldus, who had now lost everything, came to Hugh and Heribert and gave them the oaths that they required, and they returned to him the abbeys of St Basle and Avenay with the villa of Vendress. After [Archbishop] Artoldus made peace with [Archbishop] Hugh [of Reims], he took up his residence at St-Basle. Hugh and Heribert abandoned the siege of Laon. A son [Lothair] was born to King Louis. The aforesaid counts spoke with William [Longsword] and wanted to resume the siege of Laon soon, having made an agreement that the castrum of Laon would be surrendered to them by treachery. But when this did not come about, they returned home. King Louis was received in Vienne by Charles Constantine [count of Vienne]. THe Aquitianians came to him and acknowledged him [as king]. Hugh [the Great], Heribert [of Vermandois], William [Longsword] and Arnulf [of Flanders] met together, and Heribert then set across the Rhine to go to King Otto.

	24.

	In the year 942, after the Aquitanians were allied to him, King Louis returned to Laon. However, he did not remain there for a long time, for there was no peace, and he went to Burgundy. Damasus, the legate of Pope Stephen [IX], ws ordained bishop at Rome for the purpose of fulfilling this mission and came to Francia, carrying a letter of the apostolic see to the prindpes of the kingdom and to all the inhabitants of Francia and Burgundy so that they might receive Louis as their king. However, if they should fail to do this and should continue to attack him with a hostile sword, the pope would excommunicate them. Therefore the bishops of the province of Reims spoke with Count Heribert [of Vermandois] and begged him to intercede with the princeps Hugh [the Great] to accept the king.

	Some traitors were discovered at Reims and were killed. Others were deprived of the resources that they held from the church of Reims and were expelled from the urbs. The legates of the church of Reims returned from Rome, brining back with the from Pope Stephen the pallium for [Arch]bishop Hugh. They also went to the prindpes of the kingdom, so that they might receive Louis as king and send their own legates to Rome. But if this were not done by the Nativity of the Lord [25 December], they understood that they would then be excommunicated.

	Lord Abbot Odo [of Cluny] worked with Hugh, the king of Italy, and Alberic, the Roman patrician, to make peace between the two. King Hugh tried to drive out the Saracens from their munitio of Freinet. Count Roger [of Laon], who was serving in a legation from King Louis to William [Longsword], the princeps of the Northmen, died there. William received King Louis in a royal manner at Rouen. Likewise, [Count] William of Poitou and the Bretens, with their pindpes, came to the king. With these men the king came to the river Oise, while Hugh [the Great] and Heribert [of Vermandois] encambed with Otho [of Verdun], duke of the Lotharingians. After the bridges were destroyed and ships had been seized, along with the ships that they were able to take from the other side of the river, dissension was stirred up among them by the negotiators on each side and a truce was arranged to last from the middle of September until the middle of November. Hostages were exchanged, including Heribert's younger son, who was given to the king. The king [Louis] himself, along with William [Longsword] and Hugh [the Great], sent hostages to King Otto [of Germany] through Duke Otho.

	There was a great famine through all Francia and Burgundy, along with an epidemic that struck cattle, and few animals of this type survived in these lands.

	King Louis set out to meet King Otto and the two men received each other amicably and strengthened their friendship with a pact. Otto labored intensely to make peace between King Louis and Hugh [the Great], so that Hugh at least returned [his allegiance] to the king. Likewise, even Heribert [of Vermandois] and his son, also named Heribert, became [the men] of King Louis. When the king returned, the bishops of the province of Reims came to him, and Lous received [Bishop] Raoul [II] of Laon and restored his see to him.

	...25

	In the year 943, Count Arnulf [of Flanders] arranged for the treacherous murder of William [Longsword], the princeps of the Northmen, at a conference to which he had been called. King Louis then gave the land of the Northmen to William's son [Richard], born of a Breton concubine [Sprota]. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I_of_Normandy
	Richard I (28 August 932 – 20 November 996), also known as Richard the Fearless (French: Richard Sans-Peur; Old Norse: Jarl Richart), was the Count of Rouen or Jarl of Rouen from 942 to 996.[1] Dudo of Saint-Quentin, whom Richard commissioned to write the "De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum" (Latin, "On the Customs and Deeds of the First Dukes of Normandy"), called him a Dux. However, this use of the word may have been in the context of Richard's renowned leadership in war, and not as a reference to a title of nobility.[2][3] Richard either introduced feudalism into Normandy or he greatly expanded it. By the end of his reign, most important Norman landholders held their lands in feudal tenure.[4]

	...With the death of Richard's father in 942, King Louis IV of France installed the boy, Richard, in his father's office. Under the influence of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders the King took him into Frankish territory[9]:32–4 and placing him in the custody of the count of Ponthieu before the King reneged and seized the lands of the Duchy of Normandy.[10] He then split up the Duchy, giving its lands in lower Normandy to Hugh the Great. Louis IV thereafter kept Richard in close confinement at Lâon,[11] but the youth escaped from imprisonment[9]:36–7 with assistance of Osmond de Centville, Bernard de Senlis (who had been a companion of Rollo of Normandy), Ivo de Bellèsme, and Bernard the Dane[12] (ancestor to the families of Harcourt and Beaumont).[a]

	In 946, at the age of 14, Richard allied himself with the Norman and Viking leaders in France and with men sent by King Harold of Denmark. A battle was fought after which Louis IV was captured. Hostages were taken and held until King Louis recognised Richard as Duke, returning Normandy to him.[9]:37–41 Richard agreed to "commend" himself to Hugh, the Count of Paris, Hugh resolved to form a permanent alliance with Richard and promised his daughter Emma, who was just a child, as a bride, the marriage would take place in 960.[9]:41–2

	Louis IV working with Arnulf I, Count of Flanders persuaded Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor to attack Richard and Hugh. The combined armies of Otto, Arnulf and Louis IV were driven from the gates of Rouen, fleeing to Amiens and being decisively defeated in 947.[9]:41–2[13] A period of peace ensued, Louis IV dying in 954, 13 year old Lothair becoming King. The middle aged Hugh appointed Richard as guardian of his 15-year-old son, Hugh Capet in 955.[9]:44

	In 962, Theobald I, Count of Blois, attempted a renewed invasion of Rouen, Richard's stronghold, but his troops were summarily routed by Normans under Richard's command, and forced to retreat before ever having crossed the Seine river.[14][15] Lothair, the king of the West Franks, was fearful that Richard's retaliation could destabilize a large part of West Francia so he stepped in to prevent any further war between the two.[16] In 987 Hugh Capet became King of the Franks.

	For the last 30 years until his death in 996 in Fécamp, Richard concentrated on Normandy itself, and participated less in Frankish politics and its petty wars. In lieu of building up the Norman Empire by expansion, he stabilized the realm and reunited the Normans, forging the reclaimed Duchy of his father and grandfather into West Francia's most cohesive and formidable principality.[17]

	Richard was succeeded in November 996 by his 33-year-old son, Richard II, Duke of Normandy.

	Relationships with France, England and the Church

	Richard used marriage to build strong alliances. His marriage to Emma of Paris connected him directly to the House of Capet. His second wife, Gunnora, from a rival Viking group in the Cotentin, formed an alliance to that group, while her sisters formed the core group that were to provide loyal followers to him and his successors.[18]

	His daughters forged valuable marriage alliances with powerful neighboring counts as well as to the king of England.[18] Emma marrying firstly Æthelred the Unready and after his death in 1016, the invader, Cnut the Great. Her children included three English kings, Edward the Confessor, Alfred Aetheling and with Cnut, Harthacnut so completing a major link between the Duke of Normandy and the Crown of England that would add validity to the claim by the future William the Conqueror to the throne of England.

	Richard also built on his relationship with the church, undertaking acts of piety,[19]:lv restoring their lands and ensuring the great monasteries flourished in Normandy. His further reign was marked by an extended period of peace and tranquility.[18][20]

	Some of the principes of the Northmen committed themselves to the king, while others committed themselves to Duke Hugh [the Great]. Count Heribert [of Vermandois] died and his sons buried him at St-Quentim. When they heard that Raoul, the son of Raoul of Gouy had come into the lands of their father as if her were invading, they attacked and killed him. The news of this greatly saddened King Louis. [Arch]bishop Artoldus left his monastery of St-Basle and set out for the king, who promised Artoldus that he would be returned to the diocese of Reims. Artoldus gathered up his brothers and other men whom had been exiled from the bishopric of Reims, and they took possession of the castrum of Omont. King Louis and some others then attacked Mouzon, but Louis was drive off by fideles of Bishop Hugh [of Reims], and some of his men were killed. However, Louis burned some houses in the suburs of this castrum, whereby much of the harvest was destroyed.

	Hugh [the Great], the duke of the Franks, fought frequently against the Northmen who had come as pagans or had returned to paganism. They had killed a great many Christian footsoldiers (pedites) of Hugh's, but, with the agreement of the Christian Northmen who were holding the place, Hugh was able to take the castrum of Evreaux, killing many of the Northmen and putting the others to flight. King Louis set out again for Rouen and killed the Northman Turmoldus, who had returned to idolatry and to heathen rites. Tur-moldus had forced [Richard] the son of William [Longsword] and others to join him in this and he plotted against the king. Turmoldus joined with the pagan king Stricus and King Louis killed them [in battle]. King Louis then committed Rouen to Erluinus [of Montreuil] and returned to Compiegne. There Duke Hugh [the Great] waited for him, along with his nephews, the sons of Heribert [of Vermandois], and this meeting was the cause of considerable tensions.

	With Duke Otho of the Lotharingians and Bishop Adelbero [of Metz] severing as mediators, with Duke Hugh [the Great] especially insistent, the king first received [Arch]bishop Hugh [of Reims], with the understanding that [St Basle and Avenay] the abbeys that [Archbishop] Artoldus had renounced and turned over to the king would be restored to Artoldus, who would be provided with another bishopric. Morever, the honors that the brothers and kinsmen of Artoldus had held from the diocese of Reims would be returned to them. After this was done, the other sons of Count Heribert were recieved by the king. Again King Louis set out for Rouen and he received Evreux vreux from Duke Hugh [the Great]. However, the king fell ill at Paris and remained in bed for almost the entire summer.

	[Arch]bishop Hugh captured the castrum of Ambly and burned it down. The brothers Robert and Raoul, who had been expelled from Reims, were holding Ambly and using it as a base for raids throughout the diocese of Reims. Erluinus [of Montreuil] engaged [Count] Arnful [of Flanders] in battle and defeated him. He also killed the man who had killed William [Longsword], the princeps of the Northmen, and sent that man's amputated hands to Rouen. Likewise [Arch]bishop Hugh besieged the munitio of Omont, which was being held by Dodo, the brother of [Arch]bishop Artoldus. [Arch]bishop Hugh gave up the seige on the command of King Louis after taking Dodo's young son as a hostage.

	Duke Hugh [the Great] took the daughter of the king from the baptismal font and the king delegated to him the ducatus of Francia. The king [Louis] also subjected all Burgundy to his power (dido). Likewise [Duke] Hugh [the Great] brought peace between the king and [Count] Arnulf, at whom Louis had been angry due to the murder of William [Longsword, princeps of the Northmen]. King Otto [of Germany] captured some of King Louis's fideles who had plotted against Otto, which led to ill will between the two kings.

	26.

	In the year 944, King Louis and Queen Gerberga set out for Aquitaine and spoke with Ramond, the princeps of the Goths and, with other magnates (proceres) of Aquitaine, he [King Louis] returned into Francia. King Louis then gave to Ragenoldus the castrum of Montigny-Lengrain ...Members of the king's household (domestid regis) took the urbs of Aimens, which Heribert's son Odo had been holding. Bishop Deroldus of Aimens had givven his agreement to this and his own jideles had handed it over to him. THus another conflict arose between the king and the sons of Heribert [of Vermandois].

	...Hugh [the Great], the duke of the Franks, made a peace pact with the Northmen after hostages were given and received by both sides. Then [Duke] Hugh set out with Heribert's sons to meet King Otto [of Germany] in Lothair's Kingdom. However, King Otto delayed his arrival and sent Duke Herman [of Swabia] with a large army.

	...Herbert's sons took the muitio of Clastres, in the pagus of Vermandois, due to the treachery of Raoul, one of King Louis's jideles. This Raoul secretly slipped out of the stronghold when Heribert's sons entered it and plundered the treasures before abandoning the deserted munidpium.

	Duke Hugh sought to meet with Herman [duke of Swabia], who had been sent to lay seige to the castella of King Louis's jideles, Ragenarius and his brother Raoul. They did not have a fortified position (praesidium) from which they might resist Herman, and when many gifts had been given, they asked King Otto for his pardon. Otto went to the palace at Aachen and met with the Lotharingians, and the envoys of King Louis as well as the elgates from DUke Hugh appeared there as well. Otto received Louis's legates but he was hostile to the duke's legates. However, Manasses, one of Hugh's envoys, saw that Louis's men were very opposed to his own legation's mission, in the middle of the meeting made public certian mandates recently given to him by Louis to be given to Otto, which previously he did not wish to reveal. He thus disclosed harsh rebukes that King Louis had ordered him to convey to King Otto because Otto had failed to live up the oaths that he had sworn to Louis, and Manasses added many additional insults to Louis as well. Otto's anger was thus aroused and, when Louis's envoys were unable to contradict with Manass-es had said, he ejected them from his court and treated Hugh's representatives honorably and ordered his own fideles to desist from giving aid to Louis or from having contact with him.

	In the Transrhenine regions of Germany there was a man who had one of his hands cut off, but, after fourteen years had passed, it was completely restored while he slept at night, just as those who knew him aver. In these same regions, fiery iron balls were seen in the air, which burned some houses and villae as they flew around. But on some other places they were repelled by setting up crosses, by holy water and by an episcopal benidition.

	Royal soldiers plundered the diocese of Reims and Heribert's sons did the same to the lands of the abbey of St Crepin [of Soissons], and Regenoldus [of Roucy] sacked the lands of the abbey of St-Medard [of Soissons]. Thus they ran wild with either pillaging or plundering.

	A powerful storm, with very strong winds, struck the pagus of Paris, demolishing the walls of a very odl house, built with the strongest cement, which had stood intact for a very long time on the Montmartre. It was said that demons in the form of horsemen were also seen there, which destroyed a nearby church when its beams were thrown against the walls of the house. The demons also uprooted the vines that grew on this hill and they destroyed all the crops.

	Soon afterwards, the Bretons suffered a catastrophe. They were disunited due to a quarrel between the two prindpes [Judicael] Berengar [count of Rennes] and Alan [Barbatorte, count of Nantes]. Even though the Northmen had made a pact [of peace] with them, they attacked the Bretons and massacred them. Their dvitas of Dol was captured and its bishop was crushed and killed in the church by the great crowd of refugees. Finally the Bretons repaired their strenght and fought against the Northmen, seeming to have overcome them. When a third battle was engaged a large number of men were killed on each side, but the Northmen won the victory, massacring the Bretons and pushing them out of their own land. These Northmen who invaded their lands had recently come over from across the sea.

	King Louis marched into the land of the Northmen, along with Arnulf [count of Flanders], Erlinius [of Montreuil] and certain bishops of Francia and Burgundy. [Count] Arnulf advanced in front of the king and routed the Northmen who were keeping guard at Arques-la-Battaille, and he prepared the king's crossing of the river [Bethuen]. Thus King Louis reached Rouen and was received by the Northmen in the urbs, while those who were against receiving the king took to the sea, and all of the rest were subjugated to him. Duke Hugh [the Great], with his own supporters and with certain magnates (proceres) from Burgundy, journeyed across the Seine to Bayeaux and beseiged that dvitas. King Louis had given Bayeaux to [Duke] Hugh if Hugh should aid the king in conquering this group (gens) of the Northmen. King Louis was received by the Northmen and he ordered Duke Hugh [the Great] to raise the siege of the aforesaid cvitas [of Bayeux]. After Hugh departed, the king entered Bayeaux. THis led to the kindling of a quarrel between the king and the duke, as a result of which the king took hostages from Evreux vreux that had been surrendered to Hugh and refused to return them to the duke.

	27.

	In the year 955, while King Louis still remained at Rouen, at Laon Queen Gerberga gave birth to a son, who was named Charles for the purpose of instruction. The king returned to Laon and spoke with Arnulf [count of Flanders]. They resolved certain matters, and King Louis returned to Rouen. Count Bernard of Senlis, [Count] Theobold of Tours and [Count] Heribert, attacked the king's castellum of Montigny during Easter season. They captured and burned it, making it indefensible. Likewise Bernard attacked the hunters and dogs of the king, and carried off their horses and whatever else belonged to them that he could find. He also attacked the oppidum of Compeigne, which was a customary royal residence, as well as some villae that were subject to the same place.

	King Louis raised an army of the Northmen and they plundered the pagus of Vermandois. The king joined to his force Erluinus [of Montreuil] and some of the soldieres of [Count] Arnulf's, along with [Arch]bishop Artoldus and the men who had recently been expelled from Reims, as well as Count Bernard [of Rethel] and Count Theoderic, Bernard's nephew. This army layed siege to the urbs of Reims. The crops around Reims were plundered and part of them burned, and many churches were wrecked. Frequent skirmishes were fought at the gates and around the wall of the city, and many were wounded, and some killed, on both sides.

	Finally, Duke Hugh [the Great] engaged the Northmen who had invaded his territory and he routed them in a great slaughter, pushing them back beyond the borders of his lands. Hugh then sent a message to the king at Reims and gave hostages so that Ragenoldus [count of Roucy], representing the king, would come to a meeting with Hugh. When Ragenoldus departed, Hugh treated with him so that the king might accept hostages from [Arch]bishop Hugh and give up the siege of Reims, and so that [Arch]bishop Hugh might go to a placitum to provide the king with an explanation for whatever the king asked him. When all these concessions were thus given to him, the king raised the siege of Reims, which had lasted for fifteen days. Therefore, around the feast of Saint John [24 June], Duke Hugh and the king participated in a placitum through intermediaries, but no sure peace was established. However, the two sides did agree to a peace until the middle of August. After all this, King Louis went to Rouen, taking Erluinus [of Montreuil] and some of his household troops (domestici) with him.

	Lord Teotolo, the venerable [arc]bishop of the urbs of Tours, died. He had been working to make peace between the king and his principes. Occupied with this matter, he returned from Laon and was struck by a bodily illness on this journey. After he had breathed out his last breath, a sign of lights appeared coursing through the sky, which seemed to be about a cubit in length. This light was so bright that is dispersed the shadows of night and those who were carrying his body could perform the task. It was said that by this confort they gained almost 200 miles and carried his body to the urbs of Tours. Teotolo was buried reverently in the monastery of St-Julien, which the same holy man had raised to the highest standards of [monastic] religion, next to the tomb of Lord [Abbot] Odo [of Cluny]. It was then declared that this temple was made famous by divine miracles.

	While King Louis delayed at Rouen, the Northman Harold, who was in command at Bayeaux, sent a mandate to the king, stating that he himself would come to meet with the king at a time and place that was agreeable. The king came to the place with only a few men, but Harold arrivted armed, with a large number of Northmen. They attacked the king's companions and killed almost all of them. Only the king escaped through flight, followed by a certain Northman who was his faithful man (fidelis). The king came to Rouen and was captured by other Northmen whom he thought to be faithful to him and he was held under guard.

	Hugh, the king of Italy, was deprived of his rule (regnum) by his own people and his son [Lothair] was received in the royal power (regnum). [Arch]bishop Hugh laid siege to the castrum of Omont and took it after a siege of almost even weeks. Dodo [brother of Archbishop Artoldus] handed over the stronghold on the condition that this same archbishop acknowledge his son and the son of his own brother and concede to them the lands of their fathers. While Duke Hugh was involved with the matter of the capture of King Louis, the Northmen asked that the king's sons by given to them as hostages or they would not release the king. Therefore the queen was asked for the boys; she sent the younger one [Charles] but declared that she would not send the elder [Lothair]. Therefore, the younger boy was handed over to the Northmen so that the king might be set free, and, in addition, Bishop Guy of Soissons gave himself up as a hostage.

	Therefore, the king was released by the Northmen and he was taken into custody by the princeps Hugh [the Great], who handed him over to Theobald [the Trickster, of Tours], one of his men. [Duke] Hugh then set out to meet King Otto [of Germany]. However, Otto did not want to speak with Hugh and instead sent Conrad, duke of the Lotharingians, to him. [Duke] Hugh spoke with Conrad and then returned, hostile to King Otto. When Bishop Richarius of Tongres died, King Otto gave his position to Hugh, the abbot of St-Maximin [of Trier]. However, Abbot Hugh was unwilling to be made bishop and ran away. Nevertheless King Otto had him ordained bishop and returned across the Rhine.

	In the pagus of Paris and also in various pagi thereabouts, men were struck in various appendages with wounds of fire. Gradually they were burned up and consumed until at least death finished the punishments. Some of these afflicted sought out many places of the saints and escaped the torments. Many were healed in Paris in the church of Mary, the HOly Mother of God [Notre-Dame of Paris]. All of these who went there affirmed that they had been saved from that affliction. Duke Hugh [the Great] gave them food in daily stipends. Some wished to return to their homes, but there the fire began again and they returned to the church [of Notre-Dame] and were again freed of the torment.

	28.

	In the year 946, a conflict was stirred up among the sons of Count Heribert over the division of their inheritance. However, through the mediation of their uncle, the princeps Hugh [the Great], they were pacified and the inheritance was divided in an agreeable manner.

	King Hugh of Italy was recieved by his own people in the royal power (regnum).

	Edmund, king of the English, sent legates to the princeps Hugh [the Great] for the restoration of King Louis. The same princeps [Hugh] therefore held public meetings with his nephews and other magnates (primates) of the kingdom.

	Pope Marinus [II] died and he was succeeded by Agapitus. Peace was made between the patrician ALberic and Hugh, the king of Italy.

	Hugh, the duke of the Franks, received Hugh the Black, son of Richard [the Justiciar], and along with other dignitaries of the kingdom he restored King Louis in royal power (regnum) after the king had been held in custody for almost a year by Count Theobald [of Tours]. After this, Hugh recieved the castrum of Laon, which Queen Gerberga had been holding, and committed it to the same Count Theobald. Duke Hugh restored the royal honor and name to King Louis and committed himself to the king with the other magnates (primores) of the kingdom.

	...Queen Gerberga recently sent a legation to King Otto, her brother, demanding help from him. Otto gathered a very large army from all of his kingdoms and, along with Conrad [the Peaceful], the king of Cisalpine Gaul [Upper Burgundy], came into Francia. King Louis went out to meet them and was received by them in a friendly and honorable manner. Then they all went to Laon but, after considering the strenght of the castrum, they went away from it and attacked the urbs of Reims. They surrounded Reims with a siege, enclosing it with a large army. However, [Arch]bishop Hugh saw that he could not break the siege or resist such an immense army and took counsel with some principes who seemed to be his friends, namely Arnulf [count of Flanders], who had married his sister, Udo [count of Wetterau], whose wife was his aunt, and Herman, Udo's brother, askign them what he should do. They advised him to go out with his men and surrender the urbs because the kings had decied to expel him completely, and if the urbs should be taken by storm, they would not be able to intercede with the kings to prevent his eyes from being torn out. This advice was received and shared with others, and, on the third day of the siege, [Arch]bishop Hugh left the city with almost all of the soldiers who had been with him. Thus the kings [Louis and Otto] entered the urbs with the bishops and the prindpes and they had Lord [Arch]bishop Artoldus, who had been ejected a little earlier, reinstalled. Archbishop Robert of Trier and [Arcbhishop] Rederick of Mainz recieved him and, with each of them taking one of his hands, they restored to him the same episcopal throne. Then the kings left Queen Gerberga at Reims and, with their armies, attacked the lands of Hugh [the Great], besieging the urbs of Sen-lis. However, the saw that it was very secure and, not wishing to take it by storm with the slaughter of their own men, they withdrew. The kings then crossed the Seine and pillaged heavily everywhere except for the ciftates. They then crossed the land of the Northmen, devastating man places before returning to their own lands.

	Bishop Deroldus of Aimens departed this life.

	29.

	In the year 947, the princeps Hugh [the Great] set out for the lands of Arnulf [count of Flanders] with his army that he had mobilized and beseiged some of Arnulf's mintiones. However, as he expected no success, he returned home. King Louis, along with some Lotharingians, besieged Mouzon, which [Arch]bishop Hugh, who had been evicted from Reims, was now holding. However, Louis did not succeed in fulfilling his vows to take the place. After a month, the Lotharingians pulled back and Louis himself returned to Reims.

	...King Louis celebrated Easter [11 April] at Aachen with King Otto, who honored Louis with royal gifts.

	The princeps Hugh [the Great] was persuaded to make a very presumptuous attack on the urbs of Erims, along with [Arch]bishop Hugh, as though it could be captured quickly. But this wish was ruined when the fideles of the king and of Archbishop Artoldus put up a resistance. On the eight day after the attack began and looking foolish, Hugh withdrew.

	...At the wishes of Count Arnulf [of Flanders], King Louis and [Arch]bishop Artoldus set out for Arras and there joined with Count Arnulf. They then set out to besiege Montreuil, a castrum of Roger, the son of Erluinus [count of Montreuil and Ponthieu]. However, this failed and a number of men wre killed and, seeing that the siege was hopeless, they returned home.

	A great storm assailed Reims for an entire night, with continual lightning and shaking of the earth, so that wells were replenished and many houses were blown down.

	At the beginning of August, the kings Louis and Otto celebrated at the convening of a placitum on the river Chiers. The princeps Hugh [the Great] established his fortified encampemtn (castra) around Mouzon and Douzy. At the court, the bishops heard the dispute between Artoldus and Hugh, the [arch]bishops of the church of Reims. However, because a synod had not been called, the quarrel could not be resolved. A synod was arranged for the middle of November. In the meantime, the see of Reims was conceded to Artoldus, and Hugh the other bishop, was permitted to stay at Mouzon. King Otto mediated a truce or armistace of the war between King Louis and the princeps Hugh [the Great], to last until the meeting of the synod.

	Heriveus, the nephew of Heriveus, the former archbishop [of Reims], had buitl a mnitio on the river Marne [Chatillon-sur-Marne] and now plundered the nearby villae of the diocese of Reims. [Arch]bishop Artoldus excommunicated him for seizing these goods of the church. Count Ragenoldus [of Roucy] and Dodo, the brother of [Arch]bishop Artoldus, went out with some soldiers of the church [of Reims] and drove off the bandits. When Heriveus received this news, he wnet out from his own munitio with his heavily armed soldiers against our men. However, he was killed along with some of his own men. All of the other men fled, with many wounded on each side. The victors took the body of Heriveus to Reims. [Arch]bishop Hugh left Laon and took with him Theobold [the Trickster, count of Tours] and many other wrongdoers. They came to Cormicy and other neary villae at the itme of harvest and stole almost all the grapes collected from the villae in various pagi.

	The aforesaid synod was held at Verdun. [Arch]bishop Robert [II] of Trier presided, with the bishops Artoldus of Reims, Odalricus of Aacehn, Adelbero of Metz, Goslenus of Toul, Hildebaldus from across the Rhine [bishop of Munster], and Israel the Breton is attendance, along with Abbot Bruno [of Lorsche], the brother of King Otto [of Germany], Abbot Agenoldus [of Gorze] and also Odil [abbot of Stavelot] also present, along with certain oterh venerable abbots. [Arch]bishop Hugh was summoned to this synod by the bishops Adalbero and Goslenus, who had been sent to bring him to the meeting. However, he did not wish to come. The entire synod judged that the diocese of Reims should be held by Lord [Archbishop] Artoldus. It was announced that another synod was to be held on 13 Janurary. 

	30.

	In the year 948, the aforesaid synod was held in the church of Saint Peter, within sight of the castrum of Mouzon, by Lord Robert [archbishop of Trier] and the rest of the bishops in the province of Trier, along with some of those of the province of Reims. [Arch]bishop Hugh caem to the church and spoke with [Arch]bishop Robert, but he did not wish to attend the synod.

	He sent a letter from pope Agapitus [II] to the bishops by one of his clerics who had brought it back from Rome. The letter contained nothing of canonical authority, but ordered that the diocese of Reims by returned to Hugh. When the letter was read out, the bishops took counsel with the abbots and with the rest of the wise men who were present. The responded that it was not worthy or acceptable to receive the command of the apostolic legation that Archbishop Robert had recieved from the hands of [Arch]bishop Frederic of Mainz in the presence of the kings and bishops fo both Gual and Germany, and he had considered part of this command, because he had let pass without interruption the letter that [Archbishop Hugh], the ambusher of [Arch]bishop Artoldus, was showing. On the contrary, what had begun according to the rules ought to be handled according to the canons. Thus it was ordered that the nineteenth canon of the council of Carthage, concerning the accused and the accuser, be read out. When this was done, it was judged that, according to the meaning of this canon, [Arch]bishop Artoldus should retain the communion and the diocese of Reims (communio et parrochia) and Hugh, who had been summoned to two synods but had refused to comply, should abstain from the communion and rule of the diocese of Reims until he should come to a general synod, which was called for 1 August, to purge himself. Next, the bishops had this decision written down in a charter in thier presence and they appended their decision to it and dispatched it to this same Hugh. After a day, Hugh sent the character back to [Arch]bishop Robert, saying that he would be no means obey the judgment.

	Count Arnulf [of Flanders], with the approval of the princeps Hugh [the Great], captured the castrum of Montreuil.

	Meanwhile, Lord [Archbishop] Artoldus sent a letter of compaint to the Roman see. In response, Lord Pope Agapitus II sent his vicar, Bishop Mar-inus, to king Otto in order to convoke a general synod. Copies of this letter of this pope were sent from the Roman urbs especially to certain bishops of Gual and Germany summoning them to the synod.

	One 7 June the synod was convened by the command of Pope Agapitus [II] in the royal palace of Ingelheim at the church of Blessed Remiguis, to deal with the serious dispute between King Louis and the princeps Hugh [the Great], adn between Archbishop Artoldus of Reims and [Archbishop] Hugh, who had been illicitly substituted for him in the same urbs. These conflicts greatly distrubed the entire kingdom of the Franks.

	Those who came for the celebration of the synod when the aforesaid Marinus, the vicar of the apostolic see arrived, were the bishops of Germany and the Guals, namely Archbishop Robert of Trier, Artoldus of Reims, Frederick of Mainz, Wicredus of Cologne, Adalachus of Hamburg, Hildebaldus of Munster, Goslenus of Toul, Adalbero of Metz, Berengar of Verdun, Fulbert of Cambrai, Raoul [II] of Laon, Richoo of Worms, Reimboldus of Speyer...

	...When all these bishops took their seats in the church of Saint Remigius, prayers were said before the mass, according to the procedure for the celbration of the councile, and sacred authority was read out. The glorious kings Otto and Louis entered and took their seats. After the speech of the apostolic legate Marinus, King Louis rose from his side and, with the approval of King Otto, he recited his dispute in the presence of Marinus and the rest of the bishops gathered there. He recounted how he had been summoned from the regions across the sea by legates of [Duke] Hugh and the rest of the principes of Francia to receive the kingdom that was his inheritence from his father. By the oaths of all and by the acclamations of the magnates (proceres) and the soldiery (militia) of the Franks he had been rasied and consecrated to possess the height of royal government. Aftewards, he had been driven out by [Duke] Hugh and he had been attacked by tricks and had been held in custody for an entire year by Hugh. He had been able to obtain his freedom only by giving up the castrum of Laon, which Queen Gerberga had held, along with her fideles gathered from all her royal residences, when Hugh was siezing the fortification. With all these evils that he had suffered after he had received the kingdom, if anyone should reproach him for what he had done, he would purge himself or defend himself in individual combat, according to the judgment of the synod and the command of King Otto.

	Then Archbishop Artoldus rose and, accoding to the order of the Roman pope that had been given to him, he laid out an ccount of the origin and development of the conflict between himself and [Archbishop] Hugh over who should succeed as bishop of the church of Reims. After the letter had been recited to the kings, translated into the German language, Sigbaldus, one of Hugh's clerics, entered the synod with a letter that he had brought from Rome and which he had already made public at the previous synod at Mouzon. Sigbaldus asserted that the same letter had been given to him at Rome by the man who had been present with the vicar Marinus. This Marinus produced the letter that Sigbaldus had brought back from Rome and ordered that is be read out in the open synod. In the reading, it was discovered that Bishop Guy of Soisson,s and also Hildegarious of Beavais, Raoul [II] of Laon and the rest of the bishops of the province of Reims had sent letters to the Apostolic See so that Hugh might be restored to the see of Reims and Artoldus expelled from it.

	After the letter had been read, [Arch]bishop Artoldus and [Bishop] Raoul [II of Laon] rose up, as did Bishop Fulbert of Cambrai, and disputed the contents of the letter, stating that they had never seen or heard of it before, nor had they consented to the signing of the letter. Sigbaldus was not able to refute them, though he did attack them loudly with wild charges. Lord Marinus ordered the matter brought before the general council so that he might receive counsel and proper judgment concerning this man making such charges against the bishops. But the bishops of the synod, after the accuser had been shown publicly to have made false charges when the specific accusations had been read out, unanimously judged that he ought to be deprived of the office that he enjoyed and, according to the meaning of the chapters, he ought to be sent into exile. Therefore, he was reduced to the diaconate as an office he could exercise and, as a condemned man, he withdrew from the synod. THe synod decreed, praised and confirmed that according to the meaning of the canons and the decrees of the holy fathers, the diocese of Reims should be retained hy and handed over to Bishop Artoldus, who had been present at every synod and had not fled from the judgment of the synod.

	On the day after the decision [8 June], after the recitations of divine authority and the speech by the vicar Marinus, Lord Archbishop Robert of Trier suggested that, because according to the institutes of sacred law the diocese of Reims had been restored and reinstitued to [Arch]bishop Artoldus, the judgement of the synod out to be executed against the one who had invaded that see. Therefore, the vicar Marinus ordered that the synod issue a decree agains this presumption. Accordingly, it was commanded that the catholic canons of holy law be read out. THen, according to the institutes of sacred canons and the decrees of the holy fathers Sixtus, Alaxander, onnocent, Zosimus, Boniface, Celstine, Leo, Symmachus and the rest of the holy doctors of the church of God, they excommunicated and removed from the bosom of the church the aforesaid Hugh, the invader of the church of Reims, until he should do penance and make worthy satisfaction.

	The reamining days of the synod were spent on other important matters conerning incest in marriages and churches in Germany that had been soldimproperly and illicityl taken away by lay people and given to priests. This was prohibited and it was decreed that no one at all should presume to do this. Concerning other matters of need for the church of God, many other things were decided.

	Meanwhile, King Lousi sought from King Otto assistance against [Duke] Hugh [the Great] and his otther enemies. Otto granted Louis's request and ordered Duke Conrad [the Red, of Lotharingia] to advance with the army of the Lotharingians in aid of King Louis. Meanwhile, as the army was being gathered, King Louis remained with Duke Conrad [of Lotharingia], and the bishops Artoldus [of Reims] and Raoul [II of Laon], who were with the king, went to be with the Lotharingian bishops lest they should encounter opponents on the road. Therefore, we stayed with [Archbishop] Robert of Trier, [Bishop] Raoul [II] of Laon, and with [Bishop] Adalbero of Metz for almost four weeks. When the army at least had been gathered, the Lotharingian bishops went to Mouzon and besieged and attacked that castrum. They force dthe soldiers there with Hugh [the deposed archbishop of Reims] to surrender. After they took hostages from these men, they set out to meet King Louis and Duke Conrad in the pagus of Laon. Therefore, the duke [Conrad] and the army laid siege to the minitio of Montaigu that had been built by Theobald [the Trickster, count of TOurs], who was also holding it. In addition, Thebald was holding Laon against the king. The army quickly captured the oppidum and then advanced to Laon. The bishops gathered in the church of Saint Vincent [in Laon] and excommunicated this Theoboald. Also, on behalf of Marinus, the legate of the Apostolic See, by letter the summoned the princeps Hugh [the Great] to come to make amends for the evils that he had done against the king and the bishops. Finally, BIshop Guy of the urbs of Soissons came to King Louis and committed himself to the king and was reconciled with Archbishop Artoldus, making satisfaction to the archbishop for having ordained [Archbishop] Hugh.

	...When the castrum of Mouzon had been taken and demolished, the Lotharingians returned home.

	Therefore Hugh [the Great] made no delay and gathered many of his own men and a contingent of Northmen at Soissons and besieged the urbs. He killed many of the defenders and burned the house of the mother church by putting fires to it. He also burned the canons' cloister and part of the civitas. However, he was not able to capture the dvitas and he gave up the urbs. He came to a munitio that Ragenoldus [count of Roucy], one of King Louis's counts, had built at Roucy on the river Aisne, vallating the unfinished munitio. However, [Duke] Hugh was unable to take it, but he plundered the villae of the church of Reims that were close by his camp (castra). Hugh's thieves killed many of the dependents (coloni), violated the churches and raged so furiously that in the village (vicus) of Cormicy they killed almos forty men around the church and plundered that temple of everything. Then, after man offensese had been committed, Hugh and his thieves returned. Thus, the soldiered who had been with the excommunicated [bishop] Hugh up to this point returned to [Arch]bishop Artoldus. The bishop received many of them after they returned the goods that they had taken, but some of them he refused to receive.

	After these things were done, [Arch]bishop Artoldus set out to a synod at Trier with bishops Guy of Soissons, Raoul [II] of Laon and Wicfredus of Therouanne. When they arrived, the met with Marinus and Archbishop Robert [of Trier], who were awaiting them. However, none of the Lotharingian or German bishops were there. These bishops now sat down together and the vicar Marinus questioned them concerning what the princeps Hugh [the Great] had done after the previous synod with regard to them or to King Louis. They gave an account of the things mentioned above, of the evils that he had inflicted on them and their churches. Marinus asked about the summoning of this princeps [Hugh the Great and] whether or not they had actually sent the letter of summons to Hugh that he had ordered. The answer was given by Archbishop Artoldus, who responded that some of it had been sent but some of it could not be delivered to Hugh because his thieves had intercepted the bearer of the letter. Nevertheless he had been summoned both by letter and by intermediaries in person. They inquired if there were a legate present at the synod on Hugh's behalf. However, no such person was found and it was decided that they would wait for one in case he should appear on the next day. When this did not happen, all who were present, both clerics and renowned members of the laity, clamored for [Duke] Hugh's excommunication. The bishops decided to delay his excommunication until the third day of the synod. A decision was made concerning those bishops who had participated in the ordination of [Archbishop] Hugh, who had been summoned by had delayed their arrival at the synod. Guy of Soissons confessed his guilt and prostrated himself in the presence of the vicar Marinus and Archbishop of Artoldus. Archbishop Robert [of Trier] and Archbishop Artoldus [of Reims] interceded with Marinus so that [Bishop] Guy might be absolved, and he was absolved from this wrong. Wicredus of Therouanne was found not to have been guilty of that ordination. The legate Bishop Transmarus of Noyon, a priest, added that his bishop had fallen seriously ill and could not attend the synod, and our bishops who were present attested to this.

	On the third day, especially due to the insitence of Liudulfus, King Otto's legate and chaplain, and also because King Otto wished it to happen, Count Hugh [the Great], the enemy of King Louis, was excommunicated because of the evils that he perpetrated, as already mentioned. This sentence should last until he should come to his senses and make satisfaction in the presence of the vicar Marinus and the bishops whom he had injured. But if he should reject this, he should go to Rome for his absolution. Also excommunicated were two false bishops, who had been ordained by [the deposed archbishop] Hugh, who had been condemned. They were Theobald [of Amiens] and Ivo [of Senlis]. Theobald had been established bishop in the urbs of Amiens after [Bishop] Hugh had been expelled, and Ivo had been established bishop at Senlis after [Archbishop] Hugh's condemnation. Also excommunicated was Adelomus, a cleric of Laon, who was accused by Raoul [II], his bishop, of having introduced the excommunicated Theobald into the church. Bishop Hildegarious of Beauvais was summoned by a letter of the viar Marinus and instructed either to come to the vicar or to go to Rome to answer to the lord pope for his presence at the illicit ordinations of those psuedo-bishops. Heribert [the Eldar], the son of Count Heribert [II of Vermandois], was summoned to the synod to give satisfaction for the evils he had committed against the bishops.

	When these actions were taken, the bishops returned home. King Otto's chaplain Liudulfus escorted the vicar Marinus to his king in Saxony, where he was to consecrate the church of the moastery of Fulda. Following the consecration, Marinus returned to Rome after the winter had passed. In this year the bishops Geruncus of Bourges and Raoul [II] of Laon died. A son was born to King Louis, whom Bishop Artoldus raised from the sacred font and gave the name of his father.


	31.

	In the year 949, the people of Laon, who were constant in their loyalty to King Louis, chose as their bishop the deacon Rorico, King Louis's brother, and Archbishop Artoldus consecrated him bishop at Reims. however, Rorico was not received at Laon and took up his residence at the munitio of Pierrepont.

	The people of Amiens detested Theobald, whom [the deposed archbishop] Hugh had established as their bishop, and they handed over the castrum to Count Arnulf [of Flanders]. Arnulf asked King Louis for assitance and captured the oppidum and expelled Theobald. Then he introduced Ragembaldus into the diocese [of Amiens], a monk from Arras, whom the people Amiens had previously chosen as bishop. Ragembaldus was brought to the king at Reims and was ordained bishop by Archbishop Artoldus. The munitio of Omont, which was being held by Lord [Arch]bishop Artoldus's brother Dodo, was captured in an act of betrayal by soldiers of this church of Reims, who had not been received by this bishop. They then summoned the excommunicated [Archbishop] Hugh into the oppidium and recieved him there. They proceeded to raid savagely the villae of the diocese that lay nearby.

	Because the solemn day of Easter [22 April] was imminent, Queen Gerberga set out to her brother, King Otto. She celebrated Easter with him at the palace at Aachen, where legations of different peoples, that is, of the Greeks, Italians, English and others, were present.

	The queen returned to Reims with her brother's promise of assistance, and King Louis suddenly attacked Laon. During the night Louis's men secretly scaled a wall. When the bars of the gates had been broken, the king entered the oppidum and captured the guards (custodes), except for those who had climbed up the tower of the royal residence that he himself had built at the gate of th ecastrum. Louis was unable to take the stronghold and cut it off from the civitas by throwing up a wall from the inside. When Count Hugh [the Great] learned of these events, he set off to Laon with his men, while King Louis sent a legation to ask Duke Conrad of the Lotharingians to help him. Hugh [the Great] drew near the tower and established his camp in front of the gate. After installing garrison troops in the citadel with sufficient supplies, he withdrew from the hill. Therefore King Louis met with [Duke] Conrad, who spoke with Louis and arranged a truce of war between the king and Hugh [the Great] to last until the month of August. Meanwhile, Louis set out to speak with King Otto [of Germany]. After this was done, Louis returned to Reims. There Adalbertus, the son of [the late Count] Heribert [of Vermandois], came to Louis and became his man. Count Ragenoldus [of Roucy] was joined by some of the jideles of [Arch]bishop Artoldus and constructed the munitio of Mareuil on the river Marne. The castrum of Coucy-le-Chateau was handed over to lord [Arch]bishop Artoldus by the men who were guarding it for Count Hugh [the Great] and [Count] Theobold [the Trickster, of Tours], and they committed themselves to the archbishop [Artoldus]. Dodo, the brother of Lord [Archbishop] Artoldus, and the bishop's jideles, along with the Count Theoderic [of Rethel] laid siege to the praesidium of Omont, which the former [Arch]bishop Hugh and his men and entered and were now holding. The besiegers established and fortified their camp in front of the gate of this castrum.

	Count Hugh [the Great] gathered many of his own men and a band of Northmen and came to Laon. There he relieved the men who were holding the house on the citadel and replaced them with other men, along with sufficient supplies. From Laon, he set out into the pagus of Porcien and established his camp above Chaudion. From there he sent a message to King Louis, who was at Reims, appearing to seek peace. But, meanwhile, he suddenly attacked Laon in an effort to take the city. However, this attempt failed and he returned home. King Louis summoned Arnulf [count of Flanders] and some Lotharingians and pursued Hugh [the Great] all the way into the pagus of Senlis. Arnulf burned the suburb of this civitas and then returned home. Therefore Hugh [the Great] gathered a large army consisting of both Northmen and his own men and entered the pagus of Soissons. He sent the bishops Guy of Aux-erre and Ansegisus of Troyes to the king and sommoned Count Ragenoldus [of Roucy] to come to him. After oaths were sworn on each side, a truce was agreed to that would last until the Octave of easter [14 April 950]. Soon after-wards king Louis spoke with [Count] Arnulf. Count Ragenoldus [of Roucy] captured the castrum of Chatillon-sur-Marne, which had previously belonged to [Archbishop] Heriveus [of Reims], when its wall was climbed at night. Dodo, the brother of Lord [Archbishop] Artoldus, took Omont after three days' effort by a similar means.

	Pope Agaptius [II] held a synod at Saint Peter's, in the course of which the condemnation of [the deposed] bishop Hugh at Ingelheim was confirmed and the princeps Hugh [the Great] was excommunicated until he should give satisfaction to King Louis.

	A certain Bernard, who belonged to the faction of Hugh [the Great] and who held the castellum of Chauny on the river Oise, committed himself as well as this castellum to Count Adalbert [of Vermandois].

	The church of Saint Mary, located on the stream called the Arne, shone with clear miracles as health was bestowed. Likewise the church of Saint Mary on the stream called le Py shone with almost the same splendor.

	32.

	In the year 950, King Louis set out across the Meuse to seek advice and assistance from King Otto [of Germany] so that peace might be made between himself and Hugh [the Great]. Otto promised to send Duke Conrad [the Red] with the Lotharingians to Louis in order to accomplish this. Duke Conrad came with bishops and counts and conferred with Hugh [the Great] about making peace. He informed King Louis that he found Hugh agreeable and returned to King Otto after sending certain of the counts to make the king's will known to Hugh. THus King Louis and the princeps Hugh [the Great] brought their forces to the Marne to make peace. Each one was on a different side of the river and representatives were sent back and forth, with Duke Conrad, Hugh the Black [duke of Burgundy], and the bishops Adelbero [of Metz] and Fulbert [of Cambrai] serving as mediators. Hugh [the Great] came to the king and made himself the king's man and was reconciled with Count Arnulf [of Flanders], Rageholdus [count of Roucy], and Archbishop Artoldus [of Reims]. THereupon Hugh [the Great] returned the tower of Laon to the king.

	After these things had been accomplished, Hugh [the Great] had another meeting with the king at Compiegne, whereupon the epicospate of noyon was given to Raoul, an archdeacon of the same church, whom the people of noyon had chosen to be thier bishop.

	Not long aftewards Hugh the Great took his army to the urbs of Amiens and he was received into the tower that Bishop Ragembaldus [of Amiens] was holding. Hugh then besieged another tower, which was held by th emen of Count Arnulf [of Flanders]. King Louis lay ill at Laon.

	King Otto [of Germany] laid siege to Prague, the great urbs of the Wends. He received their king in subjection and made the Magyars submit to him.

	THe men of Count Ragenoldus [of Roucy] captured the munitio of Braisne on the river Vesle, belonging to the church of Rouen, by means of a secret entrance. This enraged the princeps Hugh [the Great] and he sent a message to King Louis. Louis set out for that place and expelled the invaders, returning the castrum to the previous garrison (custodii). He then sought a meeting with Hugh [the Great] and when it was concluded, the garrison (custodes) of the castrum of Coucy-le-Chateau, which had deserted [Arch]bishop Artoldus, recieved Count Theobald [the Trickseter, of Tours] into it. This angered the king, who asked Hugh [the Great] to hand the munitio over to him. But Count Theobald put up a great resistance and Louis was not able to obtain it. The king, now hostile, returned to Laon without consulting Hugh. [Count] Theobald expelled from Coucy many of those whom he found there.

	After Raoul's election as bishop of Noyon, he was ordained by Lord [Archbishop] Artoldus [of Reims]. Berengar, a princeps of Italy, was made king of Italy when, as they say, King Lothair died of poisoning.

	33.

	In the year 951, King Louis set out for Aquitaine with an army. However, before he entered that province, Charles Constantine, the princeps of Vienne, and Bishop Stephen of Clermont came to him and made themselves his men. Bishop Stephen honored the king with lavish gifts and William [Towhead] of Poitou [also duke of Aquitaine] came to meet him. While the king put off entering Aquitaine, he fell seriously ill. Letoldus [of Macon], a Burgundian count who had newly become the king's man, recieved Louis and looked after him well in this illness. When the king regained his strength, he returned to Francia.

	Meanwhile, Frderick, the brother ofBishop Adalbero [of Metz], who was betrothed to the daughter of the princeps Hugh [the Great], entered this kingdom [of Francia] and, without consulting either the king or the queen, began constructing a munitio at Fains. He frequentyl plundered about that place, which led King Louis, who was greatly annoyed, to send his delegation to King Otto [of Germany]. Otto invited the princeps Hugh [the Great] to come to him, which he did, sending two lions in avance to Otto and he himself followed close behind. The king recieved Hugh honorably during the Easter season. Hugh, being treated properly by [King] Otto, stayed there at Aachen as he and Otto celebrated Easter day [30 March]. He received many gifts from Otto and, with Duke Conrad [the Red, of Lotharingia] escourting him as far s the river Marne, he returned home.

	...King Louis's legates returned from King Otto and reported that Otto did not want Frederick or any other of his men to hold any castrum in this kingdom [of Francia], and in fact he forbade it unless King Louis should give his consent.

	the Magyars left Italy, crossed the Alps and invaded Aquitaine, staying there almost the entire summer. They exhausted that region with their plunderings and killings and then returned through Italy into their own land.

	King Louis laid siege to the munitio of Brienne-la-Vielle, which had been fortified by the robbers Gotbertus and his brother Angilbertus. He took the stronghold, whose defenders had been weakened due to want and famine, and demolished it. He then returned adn set out to meet Arnulf [count of Flanders] and Hugh [the Great]. Hugh was hostile to Arnulf because the latter had occupied the castrum of Montreuil and the former lands of Erluinus [of Montreuil] and did not wish to attend the meeting. Instead, he and Roger invaded this land and laid siege to a castrum. At [Count] Arnulf's suggestion, King Louis sent a message to Hugh [the Great] and had the siege ended. Louis arranged a trace between Arnulf and Hugh to last until the first of December.

	...King Otto [of Germany] moved into Italy. At his coming, Berengar, the king of the Lombards, fled Pavia, which Otto entered, and married [Adelaid], the wife of the deceased King Lothair. She was the sister of Conrad, the king of Jura [Upper Burgundy].

	The Saracens blockaged a passage of the Alps and took tribute from the travelers on their way to Rome, who then were allowed to pass.

	Lothair's brief "reign" came to an end with his death on 22 November 950, and Berengar II was crowned king on 15 December, with his son Adalbert of Italy as co-ruler.[54] Failing to receive widespread support, Berengar II attempted to legitimize his reign and tried to force Adelaide, the respective daughter, daughter-in-law and widow of the last three Italian kings, into marriage with Adalbert. Adelaide fiercely refused and was imprisoned by Berengar II at Garda Lake. With the help of Count Adalbert Atto of Canossa, she managed to escape from imprisonment. Besieged by Berengar II in Canossa, Adelaide sent an emissary across the Alps seeking Otto's protection and marriage. A marriage to Adelaide would have strengthened the king's position to claim the Italian throne and ultimately the emperorship. Knowing of her great beauty and immense wealth, Otto accepted Adelaide's marriage proposal and prepared for an expedition into Italy.

	First Italian Expedition

	In the early summer of 951, before his father marched across the Alps, Otto's son Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, invaded Lombardy in northern Italy.[55][d] The exact reasons for Liudolf's action are unclear, and historians have proposed several possible motives. Liudolf may have tried to help Adelaide, a distant relative of Liudolf's wife Ida, or he intended to strengthen his position within the royal family. The young heir was also competing with his uncle, Duke Henry of Bavaria, both in German affairs and Northern Italy.[56] While Liudolf was preparing his expedition, Henry influenced the Italian aristocrats not to join Liudolf's campaign.[55] When Liudolf arrived in Lombardy, he found no support and was unable to sustain his troops. His army was near destruction until Otto's troops crossed the Alps. The king reluctantly received Liudolf's forces into his command, angry at his son for his independent actions.

	Otto and Liudolf arrived in northern Italy in September 951 without opposition from Berengar II. As they descended into the Po River valley, the Italian nobles and clergy withdrew their support for Berengar and provided aid to Otto and his advancing army. Recognizing his weakened position, Berengar II fled from his capital in Pavia. When Otto arrived at Pavia on 23 September 951, the city willingly opened its gate to the German king. In accordance with Lombard tradition, Otto was crowned with the Iron Crown of the Lombards on 10 October. Like Charlemagne before him, Otto was now concurrent King of Germany and King of Italy. Otto sent a message to his brother Henry in Bavaria to escort his bride from Canossa to Pavia, where the two married.[57]

	In the year 952, King Otto [of Germany] sent a legation for his reception at Rome. When this was unsuccessful, he returned home with his wife [Adelaid], leaving some of his men to guard Pavia.

	[King] Louis and Queen Gerberga returned to Laon. King Berengar [of Italy] went to Duke Conrad [of Lotharingia], who had remained in Pavia. He was recieved into [King] Otto's fath by Conrad and was taken to King Otto. Otto received Berengar in a kindly manner, conceded to him certain things in Italy as he thought best and permitted him to return in peace. After Otto celebrated Easter [18 April] he returned to Pavia.

	Count Hugh [the Great] and his men came to the river Marne, and Duke Conrad [of Lotharingia] and some Lotharingians hurried to meet him there. Together they laid siege to the munitio of Mareuil, recently build in the river by Count Ragenoldus [of Roucy] and men of Lord [Arch]bishop Artoldus. The attackers constructed many machines and pressed the siege vigorously. After suffering losses they were able to capture the place and they burned it. The defenders were allowed to depart in [Duke] Conrad's faith. In the meantime, the nephews of Hugh [the Great], Heribert and Robert, constructed the munitio of Montfelix. Thus Hugh [the Great] and [Duke] Conrad returned to their homes.

	Without delay King Louis and Archbishop Artoldus set out, along with Count Ragenoldus [of Roucy], for the munitio on the river Marne that Hugh and Conrad had burned [Mareuil]. They repaired it and placed a large garrison (custodes plures) there. Then the king and Ragenoldus [of Roucy] set out for the vicinity of the castrum of Vitry-en-Perthois. THis fortification was being held by Walter, who had recently defected from the king and submitted himself and the castrum to Heribert [the Elder]. Louis and Ragenoldus pillaged and burned his villae and attacked the fisc of Ponthion. The king built another munitio against Vitry and placed some of the fideles from among the companions of Walter there as a garrison. He committed this munitio to Odalricus, an abbot from Burgundy, and returned to Laon. He immediately returned to Reims with the queen.

	Archbishop Artoldus expelled the clerics who were serving at the monastery of St-Basle and sent monks into hit. He then committed it to the join abbots Hincmar and Rotmar.

	At the beginning of the year 953, the princeps Hugh the Great sent legates to King Louis to confirm the peace and concord between them and asking for a meeting with Queen Gerberga. This was done and she returned to Reims, honored by gifts from him. Hugh gained the king's concession that the castrum that had been built against Vitry would be demolished. Thus the king and Hugh entered a placitum of concord and peace at Soissons in the middle of Lent.

	Meanwhile, a conflict had arisen between King Otto [of Germany] on the one side and his son Liudolf [duke of Swabia], Duke Conrad [of Lotharingia], and some of the magnates (primates) of his kingdom on the other. It came about when a son was born to Otto and his new wife [Adelaid] and Otto promised his kingdom to his new son and he had his magnates (magnates) swear an oath of faithfulness to him. This was the same kingdom that he had earlier delegated to Liudolf before his invasion of Italy. Therefore, the king removed Conrad from the duchy of Lotharingia and Conrad tried to capture Otto. The king learned of this and moved carefully, seeking Conrad's destruction. However, Conrad began to fortify his oppida. Ragenarius [III of Hainault], his long-time enemy, besieged a very well fortified castrum of his. Therefore Conrad gathered as large a body of soldiers as he could an hurried to loosen the siege. When the two forces met, many were killed on each side. Conrad fled to the urbs of Mainz.

	...A synod of five bishops met at St-Theirry in the territory of Reims, with Archbishop Artoldus presiding. Cont Ragenoldus [of Roucy] was summoned there because of the ecclesiastical goods that he had stolen, but he did not wish to appear. He asked the king to interven with the synod to prevent his excommunication. At Louis's request, the excommunication was dropped.

	King Otto laid siege to the urbs of Mainz, to which Conrad [of Lothorangia] had retreated. After almost two months, Conrad came out and spoke with the king. After receiving hostages [from Conrad], Otto went back across the Rhine. After the citadel (praesidium) of Mainz had been cleared of his soldiers, Conrad immediately went to the urbs of Metz and made a secret entry into it. At the summons of this brother Henry [duke of Bavaria], [King] Otto went to Bavari because of Liudolf's plunderings and his capture of some urbes. Conrad inflicted considerable devestation on the rubs of Metz and it is said that he then abandoned the city at the urging of Abbot Agenoldus [of Gorze].

	[Arch]bishop Wicredus of Cologne died and Bruno, King Otto's brother, was ordained bishop there. King Otto also committed to him the Lotharingian kingdom.

	Rebellion against Otto

	With the humiliating failure of his Italian campaign and Otto's marriage to Adelaide, Liudolf became estranged from his father and planned a rebellion. On Christmas Day 951, he held a grand feast at Saalfeld that was attended by many important figures from across the kingdom, most notably Archbishop Frederick of Mainz, the Primate of Germany.[61] Liudolf was able to recruit his brother-in-law Conrad, Duke of Lorraine, to his rebellion. As Otto's regent in Italy, Conrad had negotiated a peace agreement and an alliance with Berengar II and believed that Otto would confirm this treaty. Instead of an ally, Berengar II was made Otto's subject and his kingdom was subsequently reduced. Conrad felt betrayed and insulted over Otto's decision, especially with the additional empowerment of Henry. Conrad and Liudolf viewed Otto as being controlled by his foreign-born wife and power-hungry brother and resolved to free the kingdom from their domination.[64]

	In winter 952, Adelaide gave birth to a son, whom she named Henry after her brother-in-law and the child's grandfather, Henry the Fowler. Rumors spread that Otto had been persuaded by his wife and brother to propose this child as his heir instead of Liudolf.[65] For many German nobles, this rumor represented Otto's final transformation from a policy focused on Germany to an Italian-centered one. The idea that Otto would ask them to revoke the succession rights of Liudolf prompted many nobles into open rebellion. Liudolf and Conrad first led the nobles against Henry, the Duke of Bavaria, in spring 953. Henry was unpopular with the Bavarians due to his Saxon heritage, and his vassals quickly rebelled against him.[66]

	Word of the rebellion reached Otto at Ingelheim. In order to secure his position, he traveled to his stronghold at Mainz. The city was also the seat of Archbishop Frederick of Mainz, who acted as mediator between Otto and the appearing rebels. Recorded details of the meeting or the negotiated treaty do not exist, but Otto soon left Mainz with a peace treaty favorable to the conspirators, most likely confirming Liudolf as heir apparent and approving Conrad's original agreement with Berengar II. These terms rendered the treaty incompatible with the wishes of Adelaide and Henry.

	When Otto returned to Saxony, Adelaide and Henry persuaded the king to void the treaty. Convening the Imperial Diet at Fritzlar, Otto declared Liudolf and Conrad as outlaws in absentia.[67] The king reasserted his desires for dominion over Italy and to claim the imperial title. He sent emissaries to the Duchy of Lorraine and stirred the local nobles against Conrad's rule. The duke was a Salian Frank by birth and unpopular with the people of Lorraine, so they pledged their support to Otto.

	Otto's actions at the Diet provoked the people of Swabia and Franconia into rebellion. After initial defeats by Otto, Liudolf and Conrad fell back to their headquarters in Mainz. In July 953, Otto and his army laid siege to the city, supported by Henry's army from Bavaria. After two months of siege, the city had not fallen and rebellions against Otto's rule grew stronger in southern Germany. Faced with these challenges, Otto opened peace negotiations with Liudolf and Conrad. Bruno the Great, Otto's youngest brother and royal chancellor since 940, accompanied his older brothers and oversaw the arrangements for the negotiations. As the newly appointed Archbishop of Cologne, Bruno was eager to end the civil war in Lorraine, which was in his ecclesiastical territory. The rebels demanded ratification of the treaty they had previously agreed to with Otto, but Henry's provocation during the meeting caused the negotiations to break down.[68] Conrad and Liudolf left the meeting to continue the civil war. Angered by their actions, Otto stripped both men of their duchies of Swabia and Lorraine, and appointed his brother Bruno as the new Duke of Lorraine.

	While on campaign with Otto, Henry appointed the Bavarian Count Palatine, Arnulf II, to govern his duchy in his absence. Arnulf II was a son of Arnulf the Bad, whom Henry had previously displaced as duke, and he sought revenge: he deserted Henry and joined the rebellion against Otto. Lifting the siege of Mainz, Otto and Henry marched south to regain control over Bavaria. Without the support of the local nobles, their plan failed and they were forced to retreat to Saxony.[69] The duchies of Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia were in open civil war against the King, and even in his native Duchy of Saxony revolts began to spread. By the end of 953, the civil war was threatening to depose Otto and permanently end his claims to be Charlemagne's successor.

	In the year 954, the aforementioned [Duke] Conrad made an agreement with the Magrays and led them through the Lotharingian kingdom and into the lands of his adversary Ragenarius [III of Hainault] and of [Arch]bishop Bruno [of Cologne]. They plundered the area severely and, with considerable booty and many captives, they entered Louis's kingdom [of Francia]. They then passed through the pagi of Vermandois, Laon, Reims, and Chalons, and entered Burgundy. Many of them died, due both to battles and to sickness. THe rest of them returned to their own land through Italy.

	Louis, the son of the king, died at Laon. King Louis left Laon and, as he was dying, went to the urbs of Reims. Before reaching the river Aisne, a wolf appeared ahead of him. He gave chase to it but when his horse was put to a gallop he full off. Gravely injured, he was taken to Reims. He lay ill and weak for a long time and was aggrieved by elephantiasis. He was wasted by this disease and died. He was buried at [the monastery] of St-Remi [at Reims].

	Odo, the son of the late princeps Hugh [the Great], along with many magnates (proceres) of Francia and Burgundy, came to King Lothair in Laon during the Easter season. At Soissons, a royal placitum and a meeting of various principes was held. In an effort to obstruct this, Richard, the son of the Northman William [Longsword], approached until he was met by some of the king's fideles. After a number of his own men were killed, Richard fled. The young man Hugh, son of the late Count Roger [of Laon], died and was buried at [the monstary of] St Remi [at Reims]. Archbishop Artoldus of Reims died on 30 September. King Lothair, along with his mother Queen Gerberg and some of the magnates (procers) of Francia, went to Burbundy, where some bishops and magnates (primates) from Aquitaine met him.

	In the year 962

	...King Otto [of Germany] went in peace to Rome. He was received there in an amicable manner and was elevated to the imperial honor there. Then Berengar, the king of Italy, behaved unworthily and begaun to plunder and burn the regions which he should have governed.

	...A certain man named Theobald fought against the Northmen but was defeated and escaped by flight. Therefore he considered his lord (enior) Hugh [Capet] to be hostile, so he went to the king [Lothair]. He was received by Lothair and Queen Gerberga and consoled with gentleness, and then he departed.

	In the year 963, Archbishop Odelricus of Reims summoned the magnates (procers) of Francia who had occupied certain posessions of the church of Reims. Therefore, although broken by age and weakened with infirmity, I resigned the ministry of my ecclesiastical dignity in the presence of this bishop. He freed me, in the seventieth year of my life, of this yoke and, in an election by our brothers, imposed it on my nephew Flodoard. After Bishop Gibuinus had left the urbs of Chalons, the brothers Heribert and Robert besieged it. At the conclusion of the market, they burned it. Soldiers had climbed a tower there, and they were freed.

	In the year 965...

	Pope Octavian [John XII], who had received otto and blessed him with the governmental rule of the empire, left the Urbs [of Rome]. The emperor [Otto I] frequently recalled him because he had been charged with irelligiousness, but the pope did not wish to be returned to Rome. When a synod met at Rome, the emperor had John, an illustrious cleric of the same church [of Rome], elected by the Romans and ordained pope. But when Otto returned to Pavia, Octavian was received back by the Romans, but he died soon thereafter. While John was staying at Pavia with the emperor, the Romans elected Benedict, the notray of this church, who had consented to the election of John [XIII] and who had been one of his followers, and tehy had him ordained pontiff. Emperor Otto returned to Rome and summoned a large synod. John was restored to his see and Benedict was deposed by the judgmeng ot the entire synod of bishops.
