	...Several examples of sites with invisible architecture are then put forth, including Santa Rita Corozal, where research has determined that as much as 50% of structures at the site may be invisible. Background on previous work at the Punta Ycacos salt works in Paynes Creek National Park is presented, followed by detailed description of recent excavation s at Site 77. The site consists of preserved wooden posts in the sea floor and associated artifacts (including salt - making ceramics, charcoal, botanicals, chert, and obsidian). Two rectangular structures are suggested by the patterning of posts at the site. Artifact density at this site was markedly low. Preliminary analysis suggests that the structures at this site may have been used differently or for a shorter duration than other salt works sites in the lagoon.

	...For much of the history of Maya archaeology, the focus of research has been on monumental structures and the artifacts associat ed with them. Although this legacy has undoubtedly contributed important insight to Maya archaeology, important structures and artifacts have been overlooked (Aucoin 2012 , Chase 1990, Johnston 2004, McKillop 2004, McKillop 2005, Sweely 2005). At sites thro ughout the Maya area, archaeologists have been uncovering hidden structures which previously went undocumented (Chase 1990, Cliff 1986, Gerhardt and Hammond 1991, Johnston 2004, Masson 1999, McKillop 2002, Sills and McKillop 2010, Sweely 2005, Valdes and K aplan 2000). These “invisible structures” are impossible to find through regular surface survey due to the fact that they leave few or no surface traces (Johnston 2004).
