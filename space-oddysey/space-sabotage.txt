Proton rockets were known to be reliable and became the only way more or less to get to space. Around mid 2010's they started failing in unusually high numbers, and in the Russian press there were allegations of sabotage, and reports of an FSB investigation into sabotage, reports of a sensor being "rudely" installed with the help of a hammer.

Phobos-Grunt was the most high profile and unusual case of space flight failure with an allegation of sabotage. Popovkin told press it was unusual that problems keep happening when telemetry is unavailable, and this is true for phobos grunt, previous launches in Russia and missions around the world.

The press spun his statement as him accusing the U.S. of sabotage, even though he was "careful to not name a specific country." Oberg knew this but put those words in his mouth when quoted in the press anyway.

There is a history of allegations of sabotage in space flight that go back to the beginning of space flight. One astronaught said the Soviets tried to sabotage spacecraft parts, the CIA investigated space flight sabotage, and the French investigated sabotage as well.

More recently, there was a report that someone working in a NASA contractor sabotaged an electrical part for a space mission.
