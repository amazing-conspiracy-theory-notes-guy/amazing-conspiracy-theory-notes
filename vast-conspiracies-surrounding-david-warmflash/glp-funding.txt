GLP gets a lot of funding from these sketchy guys:


http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147470491100900111


they also funded "Freedom's Watch" which pushed sketchy pro-Iraq war ads


	...For many who do not have a problem with the science/religion agenda of the Foundation, the issue is then one of integrity. Is the Foundation what it says it is? Are its stated goals and its actual goals the same (as judged by who and what it funds)? Does it operate in a transparent and non-corrupt way?



probably not?


	...Of these recent Templeton Prize winners, Charles Taylor is perhaps the most controversial, in that, while Salman Rushdie was hiding from the Ayatollah’ s death sentence in the late 1980s, Taylor questioned whether freedom of speech should be considered a human right outside of the developed West, especially in countries where religions dominate (Taylor, 1989). Specifically, Taylor argued that blasphemy laws do not inhibit a free society. Charles Colson (winner in 1993) was one of the architects of the plans to spy on the Democratic party that led to the Watergate scandal, and later became a Christian evangelist in prison and founded the Prison Fellowship. 



funds sketchy people

probably is one of those front groups for funding influence ops?

paper mostly talks about cronyism

weird thing seems to be that what they do fund look like propaganda outlets, active measures

I think ended up indirectly funding Heartland Institute? or some anti-climate change thing

wikipedia also says they found Cato


	...Lest it be argued that the Templeton Foundation is two steps removed from this effort and that they should not be expected to answer for the views of their friends’ friends, it should be noted that, according to The Heartlander,45 Dr. John (Jack) Templeton, the son of Sir John Marks Templeton and now head of The Templeton Foundation, is a donor to The Heartland Institute personally (i.e., not just via the Atlas Foundation).


so the same guy who funds anti-climate change propaganda funds this guy who advocates race realism and thinks we shouldn't explore mars


https://www.heartland.org/about-us/who-we-are/michael-debow
	Professor DeBow has taught several undergraduate courses at Samford, including one which received a supporting grant from the John Templeton Foundation.


not sure which course

also involved with "Let Freedom Ring"

from Bains paper:


	...Jack Templeton is also the US $1- million -donor, co- founder, and former Chairman of an organization called Let Freedom Ring. 47 This group has also been generally skeptical of climate change. This is clear from the tenor of their news headlines on the subject. Consider these news headlines released in early 2009, for instance:

	23 January 2009: Gloom and doom over climate change “ silly ” 48 28 February 2009: NASA ’s Chief Climate Scientist Stirs Controversy With Call for Civil Disobedienc e 49 9 March 2009: Bucking the media trend on global warming “ crisis” [Promoting Heartland Institute conference detailed above] 50 30 March 2009: Cato Institute takes out full page ad disputing President ’s stance on climate change 51 2 April 2009: Do 52 New Bul bs Save Energy if They Don’ t Work? 53

anti-climate change, pro-Trump, politicizes things a lot, pro-Iraq war, in with Tea party

this paper still a little sketchy

comes off as too weak

author says "I would like to thank Sam Harris" at end...

main problem with templeton foundation seems to be that they fund Russian propaganda outlets


------


https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/21/some-philosophy-scholars-raise-concerns-about-templeton-funding
	In recent years, though, a lot more of that life-changing money has flowed into the discipline as the John Templeton Foundation -- and its $2.5 billion endowment -- began making philosophy grants. The foundation is dedicated to exploring, as it puts it, “the Big Questions of human purpose and ultimate reality,” and its earlier grant-making efforts in science had drawn criticism from some scientists. Now they’re raising the same discussions among philosophers.


funny "big questions in human purpose", apparently they decided humans don't have a purpose and must be removed!

who are they trying to fund? the next evola?

so, a few ways GLP intersections with Russian propaganda:

- intersection in funding for them and funding for anti-climate science research

- used as a foil for anti-GMO propaganda

- similar, helping to discredit Monsanto, food science more broadly?

- "transhumanism" stuff, seen promoted in Russian propaganda, Jerome Glenn

- scientific "race realism" slant, also seen in amren

- anti-religious propaganda


also a surprising amount of posts on Mars


other than that little things that give them away, like rehosting RT

also get lots of funding from these sketchy guys:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searle_Freedom_Trust
	Grantees of the Trust have included conservative and libertarian public policy organizations. Searle was one of the largest donors to the American Enterprise Institute and the largest in his last two decades.[4] The trust has also donated to the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, the Pacific Research Institute, the Reason Foundation, the State Policy Network, the Federalist Society, Donors Trust, Philanthropy Roundtable, the Institute for Humane Studies, the Collegiate Network, and the Political Theory Project at Brown University.[4][6][8]

	The Trust has donated to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC),[9][10] giving $735,000 to the organization between 2000 and 2013.[11]

	According to a 2013 analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, the Trust was among the most frequent sponsors of the attendance of federal judges to judicial educational seminars.[12]

	In 2013, the member organizations in the State Policy Network sought funding from the Trust. In December 2013, The Guardian, in collaboration with The Texas Observer and the Portland Press Herald, obtained, published and analyzed 40 of the grant proposals.[9][13][14] According to The Guardian, the proposals documented a coordinated strategy across 34 states, "a blueprint for the conservative agenda in 2014."[9] The reports described the grant proposals in six states as proposing campaigns to cut pay to state government employees; oppose public sector collective bargaining; reduce public sector services in education and healthcare; promote school vouchers; oppose efforts to combat greenhouse gas emissions;


https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Searle_Freedom_Trust
	The Searle Freedom Trust (SFT), formerly called the D&D Foundation, is a conservative 501(c)(3) private foundation, consisting of wealth inherited from pharmaceutical G.D. Searle & Company, which created the artificial sweetener aspartame marketed as "NutraSweet" and is now part of Pfizer. Daniel C. Searle formed the trust in 1988 in order to back his ideas as a "free enterprise conservative," according to former board member Howard J. Trienens. The foundation funds Americans for Prosperity, the American Enterprise Institute, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the Heartland Institute, State Policy Network, and many other right-wing groups. Kimberly O. Dennis is its executive director.[1] The trust describes itself as intending to "foster research and education on public policy issues that affect individual freedom and economic liberty."



https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/American_Enterprise_Institute
	During the George W. Bush administration, AEI was regarded "as the intellectual command post of the neoconservative campaign for regime change in Iraq," Vanity Fair noted.[3]



so there's a pattern


same guys funding GPL funding Russian propaganda, fake news outlets, anti-climate science campaigns, and pro-Iraq war campaigns

	Goldwater campaign

	In 1964, William J. Baroody, Sr., and several of his top staff at AEI, including Karl Hess, moonlighted as policy advisers and speechwriters for Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. "Even though Baroody and his staff sought to support Goldwater on their own time—without using the institution's resources—AEI came under close scrutiny from the IRS in the years following the campaign," Andrew Rich writes.[8] Representative Wright Patman subpoenaed the institute's tax papers, and the IRS investigated for two years.[139] After this, AEI's officers scrupulously attempted to avoid even the appearance of political advocacy.[8]

	 So, National Review, founded by Buckley in 1955, functioned, Felzenberg says, as Barry Goldwater’s “unofficial headquarters and policy shop” during the 1964 presidential campaign. Goldwater lost 44 states but put the Republican Party on the path to Ronald Reagan.


who I guess was working with Whittacker chambers

a kindof indirect connection to KGB...

daily kos ?? on Russian propaganda against climate change


	...The Centre is run by Michel Chossudovsky, a Canadian academic with an Emeritus position at the University of Ottawa. Chossudovsky, as it turns out, is a regular on RT (formerly Russia Today) one of two Russian media outlets currently under investigation by the FBI for their hand in disseminating Russian propaganda as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to get Donald Trump elected President.


didn't know that

how to sum up GLP?


too much of their "work" goes toward attacking their opponents and stirring controversy. And their "opponents" are almost always involved in Russian propaganda/fake news, and the way they attack them (maybe depending on the audience) helps them instead of hurting them.

Their top-two sources of funding also fund Russian propaganda outlets or or outlets that push the same narratives as Russian propaganda, particularly anti-climate-science and pro-Iraq war sentiments.

GLP itslef acts as a foil for anti-GMO propaganda (specifically calling out naturalnews, global research, counterpunch) and also puts out "race realism" propaganda in line with amren. Entine gets mentions from amren. Also more directly push russian propaganda by rehosting rt.
