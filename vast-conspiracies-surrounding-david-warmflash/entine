entine sketchy guy running GLP


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Entine
	Entine joined the World Food Center's Institute for Agricultural and Food Literacy (IFL) in September 2014 as a senior fellow. He was previously senior research fellow at the Center for Health & Risk Communication at George Mason University where he began 2011[25] and at GMU's STATS (Statistical Assessment Service).[26] Entine is also senior fellow and executive director of the Genetic Literacy Project, which focuses on the nexus of genetics, media, and public policy.

	Entine joined the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research as an adjunct scholar in 2002, and is now a visiting scholar. His research focuses on science and society and corporate sustainability. AEI Press has published three books written and edited by Entine: Crop Chemophobia: Will Precaution Kill the Green Revolution?, which analyzes the impact of chemicals in agriculture; Pension Fund Politics: The Dangers of Socially Responsible Investing, which focuses on the growing influence of social investing in pension funds; and Let Them Eat Precaution: How Politics Is Undermining the Genetic Revolution in Agriculture, which examined the debate over genetic modification (GMOs), food, and farming. 


worked in media then worked for AEI



https://geneticliteracyproject.org/writer/jon-entine/


writes a lot of speculative articles on problem with honeybees dying

also personal attacks on GMO activists

I guess his job is to help destroy food supply somehow

also writes "race realism" type stuff

	When it comes to covering bees and farming, a week does not go by without an out of context headline or a poorly written story creating misconceptions about a genuinely important issue.

	The latest fumble came over the past week when the USDA released its first-ever honey bee health survey showing an 8 percent drop in total honey bee hives since last January. A number of reporters turned this dip into scare headlines, but few dropped the ball as badly as Alan Bjerga, writing for Bloomberg. His headline: U.S. Bee Colonies Continue to Decline as Pests, Chemicals Blamed.



is he supposed to sound like a shill?


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder
	Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is the phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease),[1] the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006[2] in conjunction with a drastic rise in the number of disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America.[3] European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain,[4] Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree,[5] and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.[6]


to take a broad guess:


they have some way of killing off bees to disrupt food supply, maybe some kind of pesticide, chemical, who knows

they will say it's to discredit capitalism, have guys go on and act like shills (like entine above), say it's worth it to frame companies as destroying food supply to enegergize activists and "destroy global capaitalism" once and for all

but actually they just want to destroy the global food supply



https://www.march-against-monsanto.com/epa-finally-admits-what-has-been-killing-bees-for-decades/
	In a report released this week, the federal government has finally admitted neonicotinoids are to blame for the catastrophic bee deaths that have occurred over the last several years. The findings are part of the first scientific risk assessment to be done on the controversial insecticides and their affect on bee colonies.

------

not much to work with

John Entine talks about bees, and Russian propaganda also talks about bees??

the back and forth between him and naturalnews, Russian propaganda outlets is something

getting cited on amren

pushing the same narratives as Russian propaganda along with Warmflash

https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/12/21/jon-entine-breaks-taboos-sports-race-future-human-genetic-research/
	In many sports in which the barriers to competition is level, athletes of African descent are over represented at the elite level. African descended athletes own every major running world record, and dominate in the elite sports of American football and basketball. But intriguingly, in the world's strength-focused competitions, from weight lifting to the hammer throw, Eurasian whites dominate. Why is there these differences based on ancestry? And why are we so uncomfortable in discuss what appear to be 'racial' differences?

	Genetic Literacy Project director Jon Entine, author of the best selling book Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid To Talk About It, wrote about this phenomenon most recently in the wake of the Rio Olympics: "Kenyans sweep distance races, Jamaicans sprints: How evolution has shaped elite sports."

	Entine now addresses these and other questions on race, evolution, ethics and the implications for genetics research with Freedomain Radio host Stefen Molyneux.


Jon Entine "just asking questions" with Russian propagandist Stefen Molyneux

so here's a "guilt by association" kindof thing


https://twitter.com/stefanmolyneux/status/872827371640020992
	Apparently Russia was smart enough to hack the United States election, but not smart enough to cloak their Russian IP addresses. Sigh.




it's like Warmflash getting funding from funders of Russian propaganda, working with people who put out Russian propaganda and work with obvious Russian propagandists (GLP not many members, cowrites weird things with Entine, GLP rehosting Russia Today)

then himself puts out things in line with Russian propaganda

so can conclude he is a Russian propagandist

or reasonably guess he is

	Those who do not understand the power of genes might argue that the medal podium for runners should reflect a rainbow of diversity, as no country or region should have a lock on desire or opportunity. But just the opposite has happened in track and field: elite running has become almost entirely segregated by ancestry. African descended athletes dominate. And field events are dominated by athletes of Eurasian ancestry.


I guess here entine is trying to sneak in race realism from this angle


	...The most frequently heard reason for this pattern by skeptics, including many scientists, is that Rift Valley Kenyans and Jamaican athletes just work harder at running. They had to run back and forth to school. It’s a way out of often deplorable poverty. There are in fact some cultural factors in play, just as there are cultural reasons for why Dominicans excel in baseball. In the case of Jamaica, the British introduced organized and informal athletics, and interscholastic competition, to the island and other colonies in the late 19th century, and running was the central sport--sprints and long distance.


trying to sound provocative, racist on purpose?

like can read as "Jamaica got the idea of athletics from the British"


	...Blacks still find it difficult to break into many specialized or country-club sports, like bobsledding or golf, in which equipment costs are steep.

	These are difficult questions to ask let alone answer. "Even today, few scientists dare to study racial origins, lest they be branded racists just for being interested in the subject," Jared Diamond, author of the Pulitzer Prize winning book Guns, Germs, and Steel, has observed.


more "just asking questions," but in this one actually talks about intelligence


	...We previously alerted Genetic Literacy Project readers to Unz’s provocative cover story in American Conservative last July on “race and intelligentce.”




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Unz
	In 2016, Unz started "Free Harvard, Fair Harvard" campaign, centered on the Harvard Board of Overseers. Its slate of candidates is Unz, Lee Cheng, Stuart Taylor, Jr., Stephen Hsu, and Ralph Nader. The campaign seeks for tuition fees at Harvard to be abolished and for greater transparency in the admissions process.[15][16]

	...In November 2013, Unz launched the website The Unz Review, a blogging platform which "bills itself as an 'alternative' to the 'mainstream media'".[19] According to the Anti-Defamation League, the webzine "provide[s] a new outlet for certain writers to attack Israel and Jews".[20]


https://www.google.com/search?q=ron+Unz+site%3Aamren.com&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-1-ab

unz gets discussed on amren a lot


Russian propaganda on his americanconservative website too

so here Entine is promoting another Russian propagandist


https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/01/14/ron-unz-on-genius-iq-race-and-meritocracy/
	...The backdrop for this debate is fascinating, as Unz describes it, quoting from numerous books on the subject. Until the 1920s, admission to the Ivys was generally meritocratic, based on IQ and test scores. Jewish enrollment soared to 25 percent or more at the top schools, which scared some people in the Protestant establishment. As anti-Jewish sentiment escalated in the 1920s and 30s, each of the Ivys introduced “subjective” standards into its admission screening process as a way, they said at the time, to bring “balance” to the student body—similar to the argument used to support the introduction of racial quotas in the 1970s to increase enrollment by minority applicants, including Asians. However, in the 1920s and 30s, it was used to restrict Jewish enrollment, which fell with a year or two to the low teens. It was, in effect, a racial quota that limited meritocratic admissions.

	Now, Unz, who is a graduate of Harvard University and Jewish, argues—you the reader can decide how persuasively—that the Ivy League universities are again using subjective and even arbitrary selection procedures, but it’s effect is to dramatically and unfairly limit enrollment by high performing and deserving Asians and white Christians, with the biggest beneficiary being Jews.


hard to see any other reason to write this except to stir shit


	...You may or may not agree with Unz’s conclusions, but I urge you to read his analysis with an open mind. Wherever you come down on these complicated and potentially inflammatory issues, there is room for constructive discussion. In fact, the first wave of reactions has already begun to stream in, and is captured by the American Conservative on January 9, 2013. The responses range across the ideological spectrum and reflect mostly thoughtful people struggling with different aspects of Unz’s data and analysis. That’s what liberal thinking is all about.


hmmm



	
https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2012/09/28/race-in-medicine/
	Race in medicine
	Jon Entine

	Biopolitical Times, an online publication of the Center for Genetics and Society, rekindled the debate over race with a recent commentary by Jessica Cussins on the value of the concept in medicine. Although not as biased in its coverage of genetics as anti-biotech campaigners and such groups as the ill-named Council for Responsible Genetics, it is known for its selective analysis of hot button genetics issues, the validity of the race concept among them.

	Cussins stumbled out of the gate, writing that the “legitimacy of race as a biological concept has been largely discredited,” but offering no links to support that contention. The best Cussins can muster is an unlinked quote from a college student. Yet, as she notes in the very same sentence, racial categories (often as crude proxies for genetic differences between populations) are currently ubiquitous in medicine and medical research.”

	Are research scientists just not as smart as Cussins? Are they just stubborn, hanging onto outdated and dangerous ideas?


seems like he likes to troll people, hold them up for ridicule those who don't want to debate the merits of whether or not different races have different IQs

The mixed findings are likely to intensify ongoing debates about restricting or banning the compounds, with both sides claiming vindication."


https://www.wired.com/2016/08/jerry-hayes-how-to-save-the-bees-monsanto/ "Hayes’ audience, however, believes something else. SXSW Eco is a conference for environmentalists, and these attendees are not inclined to blame the honeybee’s problems on an obscure arthropod. They’d rather blame Hayes. That’s because Hayes works for Monsanto, the St. Louis-based agricultural behemoth that environmentalists love to hate (and, I should add, the sponsor* of this panel, which I am moderating)."

lol


	...Scientists are also not one issue voters; many have had qualms about the EU's position on GMOs or crop protection chemicals, but otherwise might have been wary of severing the long-standing political links because of other issues. Scientists tend to be liberal minded people with global perspectives and are wary of nativist sentiments. They may fault the EU for aligning with ideologically motivated NGOs on GM food policy, but the GM issue is just one of a plethora of their concerns.


a lot of writing comes off as puting people into different camps and saying they don't like each other

maybe they want scientists to read this and become elitist pricks

	Natural News' Mike Adams libelously attacks Science-Based Medicine's David Gorski
	Jon Entine, David Gorski
	May 2, 2016

	One of the most respected online voices for science-based thinking—oncologist and science literacy advocate David Gorski—is under vicious attack from one of the leading pseudo-science promoters on the Internet, Mike Adams, founder and chief writer on NaturalNews.com. You may never have heard of the site if you are not familiar with the fringe world of homeopathy, vaccine denial, chemtrails and the like.


giving fake news a soap box


	NaturalNews is a natural products website that campaigns against GMOs, vaccines, fluoridated water and just about every technological and public health advance science has brought us (Read the GLP profile of Adams and Natural News here).


a little over-the-top


	...Now he's targeting Dr. Gorski. He is a Professor of surgery at Wayne State University School of Medicine and a surgical oncologist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, specializing in breast cancer surgery. But he's equally renowned for his selfless work as writer and managing editor of the website Science-Based Medicine, where he campaigns against alternative medicine, focusing on a range of issues including the anti-vaccination advocacy groups and, at times, the anti-GMO movement.

	Adams went after the wrong guy.


lol


	Gorski has previously written numerous articles about Adams—indeed he has called him “one of the most wretched hives of scum and quackery on the Internet,” and the most “blatant purveyor of the worst kind of quackery and paranoid anti-physician and anti-medicine conspiracy theories anywhere on the Internet.” This time he responds to a coordinated massive Adams assault—one not seen since Adams went after me (Jon Entine) beginning in 2014—one that continues.


I remember how this works now

it's like a play

agit-prop


doing the same for global research:


https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/08/11/monsanto-in-the-anti-gmo-crosshairs-fair-or-foul/
	According to standard issue anti-GMO ideology, Monsanto is emblematic of and at the root of all that is wrong with food and agriculture.

	“Of all the mega-corps running amok, Monsanto has consistently outperformed its rivals, earning the crown as “most evil corporation on Earth!” opines a familiar rant by the Centre for Research on Globalization, a far left Canadian NGO. “Not content to simply rest upon its throne of destruction, it remains focused on newer, more scientifically innovative ways to harm the planet and its people.”

	The pressure on many leftists who do support crop biotechnology is so strong that they often couple their endorsement of GMOs with a pro forma gratuitous swipe at Monsanto, treating it like a crazy uncle or worse, so as not to lose credibility with fellow liberals that they align with on other issues.

	Let’s examine four of the major claims targeting Monsanto and match them up against the empirical facts...


I guess "energizing" fight with fake news types while sounding like a Monsanto shill

presumably they have a lot of agents in monsanto? so can use them as a prop


	...“It’s not science fiction anymore,” screams CounterPunch.org, a far left website that purports to report on the media. “Monsanto Seeks to Control World’s Food.”



https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/07/28/fbi-turns-up-heat-on-mike-adams-as-health-ranger-fiasco-widens-plus-adams-archive/
	Adams posted a screed on his website (this pre-censored post, since sanitized by Adams, has been preserved on the wayback machine archives) attacking supporters of genetic engineering as modern day Nazis, suggesting that anti-GMO activists should consider murdering scientists and journalists for their crimes against humanity.

https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/04/01/think-eugenics-discredited-practice-think-back/
	You think "eugenics" is a discredited practice? Think again, it's back.

	Jon Entine

	...My concern is that the CCDC’s framing of the issue undermines support for genetic testing, particularly before conception. Lewis, Reiskin and a slew of commentators regularly deploy the word “eugenics” as if it’s a synonym for genocide.

	...Eugenics is typically portrayed as morally repugnant by today’s standards. But eugenics (meaning simply “good genes”) has its roots in the progressive era at the turn of the twentieth century

	...Scientists offered what they considered to be a progressive solution: “positive eugenics,” which focused on better pre-natal and natal and health care and encouraged society’s healthiest citizens to have more children. The founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, along with many major Protestant and Jewish clergy, were eager proponents of positive eugenics.

	...By the 1930s ideologues of the far right twisted eugenics to justify Nazism and genocide. Their exploitation of the practices led to the now widely accepted view that the “eugenics movement” as a whole was intrinsically evil and inhumane,

	...Modern eugenic aspirations are not about the draconian top-down measures promoted by the Nazis and their ilk. Instead of being driven by a desire to “improve” the species, new eugenics is driven by our personal desire to be as healthy, intelligent and fit as possible—and for the opportunity of our children to be so as well. And that’s not something that should be restricted lightly.

entine vs. natural news (Mike Adams) reminiscent of KGB agents attacking each other from positions of influence, basically using influence to start a fight


https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4870004,00.html
	Another Mapam politician, who according to the Mitrokhin documents provided the Soviets with information about Israeli foreign policy, was Moshe Sneh, who was the head of the Hagana's national staff and later a prominent public figure. The information Sneh allegedly passed on further confirmed to the Soviets that Israel was developing a special relationship with the United States. 


https://www.timesofisrael.com/soviet-documents-said-to-reveal-abbas-was-kgb-agent-in-syria/
	Soviet documents ‘show Abbas was KGB agent’; Fatah decries ‘smear campaign’


Fatah was started by KGB agent Abas, and Moshe Sneh was KGB. Here is one example of Sneh trashing Fatah, basically one KGB agent attacking another:

https://books.google.com/books?id=JLquAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT331&lpg=PT331&dq=%22Moshe+Sneh%22+Haddad+OR+Arafat+OR+Abbas&source=bl&ots=XqKGZZIfUE&sig=1H7PO2fL0gV99j8CQ8nelSOiMhs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC3vrPkITZAhXDxlkKHQfzCLkQ6AEIWDAM#v=onepage&q=%22Moshe%20Sneh%22%20Haddad%20OR%20Arafat%20OR%20Abbas&f=false


other examples: Bolsheviks and Okhrana trashing each other during Russian revolution

Malinovksy giving violent anti-gov speech while working for gov

the whole Okhrana strategy of splitting the party in the first place, shows their methods

Samuel Dickstein iirc trashed Soviets for awhile in HUAC, helped found HUAC

same thing could have happened for sino-soviet split, but not necessarily for purpose of dividing people, maybe more like a cover


idea that a lot of this is just KGB agents aruging with each other and dragging others into a fight, pick a side


...


for this instance, looks like they just want more people to buy this particular line of fake news? they just have entine and Warmflash acting as a foil, like pro-GMO pro-Monsanto boogeymen

I think naturalnews and similar had more viewers than GLP

and idea is if they want people angry, best way is to give them heroes and villains. And to control them, control both.


what is end result, point of controlling anti-GMO movement?

foment distrust in government, scientists is one

dunno if realistic if they could damage food supply greatly in this way--more demand for "organic" food probably means less food output overall and priceier, making starvation for poor more likely

toward that end did see signs of agents of influence pushing for non-GMO food production

GLP also posting on this subject in other ways, like the loss of honeybees which also impacts availability of food. And entine likewise writes posts on these in a way that arouse suspicion and distrust.


but examples or otherwise, can point out that the best way to get people to think there's a government/corporate conspiracy to coverup problems with GMO and pesticides is to have someone go and act the part, and that's what entine and warmflash did, while specificially naming and attacking fake news outlets
