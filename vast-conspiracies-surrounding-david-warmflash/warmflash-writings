warmflash seems to have a lower propaganda drivel per article rate than entine

like don't think this is propaganda: https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/10/31/brain-perceives-time/


would have to read into it

like maybe trying to argue "brain is a machine" point of view in that article

ties into his main schtick which is to discredit religion


but click on any entine article and it has a weird slant

a pattern in Warmflash writings is basically "we need to genetic engineer oursleves/our food/etc. to go to space!"

ties in with his idea that we are "not ready" to cruise space and pow-wow with aliens and the "undeseirables" who don't see his point of view are holding us back (or somehting like that)

a lot of articles on genetic engineering, "enhancement" for plants, animals, people

also some anti-anti-GMO articles


also in general Wamrflash is also talking about how "sad" it is that so many people are "illiterate on the issues" and "afraid of things they don't understand" or something like that

kindof promotes elitism

	Still, the hysteria remains, particularly in Europe --which is strange because the very same travelers who avoid x-ray scans then fly on an airplane where each hour of flight exposes them to 40 times the dose of ionizing radiation from one of these scanners. Rest assured, when you fly, there is some ionization of some of your cell membranes and DNA molecules, and heating of some tissues, which you do not have from the airport scanning machines. So by the EU rational, maybe you should avoid air travel, based on a lack of safety studies.

	This illiteracy about science and risk underlies skewed perspectives in public discussions on matters involving radiation.

here he is with "genes make you smart" article


	...So what role does genetics play in determining mathematical aptitude? You can find articles claiming that genes account for 40 percent, 50 percent or even 75 percent. They're all based on valid studies seeking to determine how much is nature versus nurture. That may sound trite, but it's just the way things are. The macroscopic and microscopic architecture of the human brain develops based on cell-to-cell interactions and a biochemical milieu resulting from one's specific genomic content and the expression of the genes that comprise it. Precisely how those genes are expressed and how the resulting structures perform depends on the environment - particularly the educational environment.


doesn't come off as "in your face" as entine, like he really believes it and wants others to believe it, not just to troll

doesn't mention a bunch of races like entine, more sublte, just saying "well you see intelligence is tied to genetics, you know like mabye 75%..."

a big part of Warmflash's writings, attitude is hinting that some people are genetically inferior and generally being down on them in a condescending way


this shows up in his anti-anti-GMO writings too:



https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/12/14/orthorexia-nervosa-anti-gmo-activists-shoppers/
	Orthorexia nervosa: Do anti-GMO activists and shoppers have it?
	David Warmflash 

	The idea that strict devotion to “eating pure” can be a feature of mental illness, or even a specific psychiatric diagnosis, has made the news several times over the last year. Coined by Steve Bratman in 1997, the term “orthorexia nervosa” (ON) refers to a preoccupation with eating foods perceived to be healthy, and avoiding foods perceived to be unhealthy, to a psychopathological extreme.

	...While the fate of ON hangs in the balance one thing is clear: the discussions about it are causing symptoms of anxiety among the elites of perceived healthy eating, those who promote exclusive purchase and consumption of foods lacking “chemicals”, gluten, or even a molecule derived from plants produced via transgenic technologies, gene editing, ...or intervention with post-translational processes (all called “GMOs” arbitrarily in public discourse, at the exclusion of certain older technologies whose modifying effect on the genomes of organisms is actually much more dramatic). This suggests that whatever the eventual outcome of the ON diagnosis, at least some fraction of “natural” food advocates, the leaders in particular, may have at least one trait that generally is not considered to be in-line with perfect mental health.

	...And no, despite accusations by the author in the Natural Society article, pharmaceuticals are not likely to play a major role in treatment for ON. Rather psychotherapy is more likely to be the strategy, cognitive behavioral therapy in particular, which seeks to change thought patterns that are built on multiple layers of incorrect assumptions and fallacies. Just like the anti-GMO movement.



https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/03/29/gmos-cause-allergies-no-anti-gmo-parent-just-might-contribute/
	Do GMOs cause allergies? No, but being an anti-GMO parent just might contribute
	David Warmflash


	...Many of these high-income parents also share a tendency to purchase organic and non-GMO food — or at least to shop in stores focused on those products.

	So it is, indeed, possible that there is relationship of sorts between food allergies and GMO foods. But if so, it’s the opposite of what critics claim. It’s not the GMOs, but rather one of the behaviors of those who seek to avoid GMOs.


https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/01/05/real-story-anti-gmo-teen-sensation-rachel-parent-idealist-pawn-natural-marketers/
	Real story of anti-GMO sensation Rachel Parent: Idealist or pawn of ‘natural’ marketers?
	Jon Entine & David Warmflash

	...She’s only 18 years old, but the Canadian high school student has become a canny, international crusader

	...The tone of her voice, smug chuckling, and the shake of her her head were all perfectly timed, sending a message that you’d have to be crazy not to agree with her that GMO corn is something you’d want to avoid. That’s why, she insisted, kids have a “right to know”.

	...whether she will acknowledge it or not she’s a front for the ‘natural products’ anti-GMO movement who have done everything in the power to deny the public a right to know about the very real dangers of many “natural” supplements.


lol they have to be doing this on purpose


	...How ironic that the literal poster child for the anti-GMO ‘right to know’ movement is the daughter of a family who has made millions of dollars selling quack notions to the public about supplements while fighting tooth-and-nail to prevent the public from knowing the truth about the scientifically demonstrated dangers of the mostly useless, unlabeled products that they sell. So much for Rachel and her parents commitment to a ‘right to know.’

	Because of those concerns, the Genetic Literacy Project contacted Parent and her father’s company by email and through her website contact forms with requests for a statement to include in this article. Neither Rachel, nor her father’s business has responded, but we do hope that they’ll send comments now that this article is published.

	...In a recent piece on Huffington Post, Jon Entine followed a similar line of attack to denigrate Rachel Parent, her family’s business interests and the campaign which she heads, Kids Right To Know (KRTK). He calls Parent a well-polished ‘crusader’ against GM food.

	Rachel Parent’s campaign (Kids Right To Know) on GMO labelling has been the subject of a GM industry strategy aimed at countering her message.

	.. @SmartBalance I stopped buying SB when you started with ridiculous non-GMO labels yrs ago. Happy to see them gone now. Are you recommitting to #science by supporting the #biotechnology that we need to feed humanity into the future? If yes, I will promote you. Let me know..

	Mutant proteins do deserve anonymity because its commercial advantage benefits shareholders, and there is a noble cause in feeding their voracious appetites well into the future

	Concern about "mutant proteins" in a product that's 100% lipid illustrates wonderfully the neuroticism and nutritional and biochemical illiteracy that drives the #antiGMO movement. Join me in supporting science and rejecting fear mongering food woo..


weird

sounds like a pro-GMO shill

intentional or no?


same thing with entine vs natural news but on twitter


"GM Know" looks like some kind of snarky anti-GMO missionaries

his general schtick looks like he's a foil for most fake news about science and health

like he attacks people who believe it in an elitist way, which would help them believe it more

	Spreading a tall tale also gives people something even more important than false expertise—it lets them know who’s on their side. If you accuse someone of being a witch, or explain why you think the contrails left by airplanes are actually spraying harmful chemicals, the people who take you at your word are clearly people you can trust, and who trust you. The people who dismiss your claims, or even those who just ask how you know, are not people you can count on to automatically side with you no matter what.

	“You spread stories because you know that they’re likely to be a kind of litmus test, and the way people react will show whether they’re prepared to side with you or not,” Boyer says. “Having social support, from an evolutionary standpoint, is far more important than knowing the truth about some facts that do not directly impinge on your life.” The meditation and sense of belonging that Daniel Shaw got from Siddha Yoga, for example, was at one time more important to his life than the alleged misdeeds of the gurus who led the group.

	...While this may appear to be a remarkable feat of self-deception, Dan Kahan thinks it’s likely something else. It’s not that they really believed there were more people at Trump’s inauguration, but saying so was a way of showing support for Trump. “People knew what was being done here,” says Kahan, a professor of law and psychology at Yale University. “They knew that someone was just trying to show up Trump or trying to denigrate their identity.” The question behind the question was, “Whose team are you on?”

	In these charged situations, people often don’t engage with information as information but as a marker of identity. Information becomes tribal.
