Warmflash being a member of "Genetic Literacy Project" (GLP) is noteworthy, since their writings, funding, and other members (notably director Jon Entine) intersect with fake news and "Russian propaganda:"

	From Balkan wars to World War I

	From the time of the Balkan wars of the 1870s, the Rus­sians maintained and expanded their intelligence apparatus in the Balkans, including the Okhrana, or secret police. The Balkans was the largest area targeted for investment of mon­ey and manpower by Russian intelligence in the pre-World War I  period. Ultimately, the alliance between these Rus­sians (who were not always represented in official Russian policy) and the Serbians led to the detonation of World War l.

	One of  the key  players in  this  collaboration was N.G. Hartvig, the Russian ambassador to Belgrade, who was ap­pointed in  1909. Hartvig was one  of  the  most wild-eyed pan-Slavic expansionists, and, according to students of the period, in many respects the actual ruler of Serbia between that year and 1914.

	Another was Colonel Apis, an advocate of Serbian Ortho­doxy and  the  founder of  a  secret society called the  Black Hand. The purpose of  the  Black Hand was "in  order to achieve the ideal of unification of Serbdom; all Serbs, regard­less of sex, religions, or place of birth, can become members, and  anyone else  who is  prepared to  serve this  ideal faith­fully. "

	The third crucial figure was Russian military attache in Belgrade, Viktor Artamonov. Artamonov came to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, in 1912. He himself reports a discussion with Serbian heir-apparent Alexander, in which Alexander asks him  what Russia would do  in  the  event of  a  war  of the  Balkan  states against Turkey. Artamonov remarks, "I allowed myself to be guided in my answer to His Highness by my sentiments as a Slav. "

	...Khrushchev’s call for the plundered wealth to be returned as economic aid was music to the ears of many of his Third World listeners.— The fact that neither the United States nor the European colonial powers yet took seriously the problems of racism within their own societies increased the popularity of anti- imperialist rhetoric. 

	...A country riven at the best of times by ethnic and regional rivalry, enduring wartime conditions so terrible that several million of its inhabitants were forced to leave their homes and seek a miserable refuge abroad, was ideal terrain for Service A’s well-practised techniques for stirring up mutual suspicion.

	Sun Tzu said, "All warfare is based primarily on deception of your enemy. To fight on the battlefield to achieve your goals is the most primitive and barbaric to achieve your goals. The highest art of war is not to fight at all, but to subvert anything of value in your enemy's country." Which includes religion, moral principles, traditions, and natural established relationships between people, families, groups, classes, races.  Turn the blacks against the whites; turn the teachers against students; turn Ralph Nader against the government; labor unions against business; homosexuals against heterosexuals; and keep on fighting, my dear friends, until you demoralize and destabilize yourself and then you flop like a rotten apple and the enemy will take you over. You will invite the enemy.

	Racial tensions were high in the US during the 1960s. Race riots surrounding the Civil Rights Movement were causing mass unrest across the country. The KGB thought that they could exploit this and make it worse by inducing animosity or outright violence between racial groups in the US.

	The plan, called Operation PANDORA, began with the KGB spreading fake pamphlets that appeared to be from the Jewish Defense League, a right-wing Jewish political organization now classified by the FBI as a terrorist organization. The pamphlets, which were actually penned by the KGB, claimed that black Americans were attacking Jews and looting Jewish-owned shops in New York. The fake pamphlets implored their readers to fight against “black mongrels.” The KGB then sent these anti-black flyers to black militant groups, hoping it would stir anti-Semitism in the black organizations, if not outright violence.

	Concurrently, the KGB was also sending fake letters to black militant groups which claimed that the Jewish Defense League had been targeting and attacking blacks in America. The letters implored the black militants to attack the Jewish Defense League in retaliation. The Jewish Defense League’s leader, Meir Kahane, was assassinated a year later, though the act was carried out by an Arabic man who was seemingly unconnected to any black militant groups.

	As part of their operation to stir racial unrest, the KGB also planned to blow up a black college. After the college was bombed with a planted explosive device, the KGB planned to make anonymous calls to a series of black organizations and claim that the Jewish Defense league had been behind the bombing.

	The DNA Olympics—Jamaicans Win Sprinting ‘Genetic Lottery’—and Why We Should All Care

	Jon Entine, Forbes, August 12, 2012

	...The trends are eye opening: Athletes of African ancestry hold every major male running record, from the 100 meters to the marathon. ...Over the last seven Olympic men’s 100-meter races, all 56 finalists have been of West African descent. 

	...What’s going on here? The most frequently heard explanation is that African athletes just work harder at running.

	...National Public Radio recently carried just such a speculative piece on Kenya, and CNN had its own version on Jamaica. Never did the word “genetics” find its way into the story. It’s all nurture, they concluded—the long since scientifically discredited tabula rasa theory of human achievement that attributes all success to individual effort and societal “forces.”

	No one outside of the most politically correct circles really believes that.

	...Sports ability, like IQ, is the product of many genes with environmental triggers influencing the “expression” of our base DNA.


https://www.amren.com/archives/back-issues/april-2004/
	Sociologists, anthropologists, and television commentators tell us that race is biologically meaningless, that the physical differences between Danes and Pygmies are insignificant evolutionary accidents. Race, we are told, is an artificial concept white people invented only a few hundred years ago to justify colonization and slavery. If we free ourselves from this delusion, we can all march hand in hand into a future free of “racism.”

	Everything about this view of race is obviously wrong, but since so few of the people who know better are willing to say so, this nonsense is beginning to tighten its grip on the popular mind.

	...Prof. Sarich and Mr. Mielealso describe clear racial differences in athletic ability, relying heavily on Jon Entine’s book on race and sports (reviewed in AR, Feb. 2000).

	To the usual yelping that accompanies the slightest dissent from racial orthodoxy, someone has finally written a book that states the obvious: blacks dominate many sports because they have a genetic edge. Bravo for author Jon Entine but bravissimo for Public Affairs publishing, which has broken with what is one of the most conformist and cowardly industries in the country.

	...However, despite all the jabber about “racism,” Mr. Entine is careful never to deny the possibility of intelligence differences. He even writes sentences like: “The evolutionary crucible has left population groups with distinct physiques, musculature, testosterone levels, metabolic efficiency, reaction time, and a slew of other characteristics.” (emphasis added) He even writes that black babies are born after a shorter gestation period and mature more quickly than white babies. He knows, all right.

	In many sports in which the barriers to competition is level, athletes of African descent are over represented at the elite level. African descended athletes own every major running world record, and dominate in the elite sports of American football and basketball. But intriguingly, in the world's strength-focused competitions, from weight lifting to the hammer throw, Eurasian whites dominate. Why is there these differences based on ancestry? And why are we so uncomfortable in discuss what appear to be 'racial' differences?

	Genetic Literacy Project director Jon Entine, author of the best selling book Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid To Talk About It, wrote about this phenomenon most recently in the wake of the Rio Olympics: "Kenyans sweep distance races, Jamaicans sprints: How evolution has shaped elite sports."

	Entine now addresses these and other questions on race, evolution, ethics and the implications for genetics research with Freedomain Radio host Stefen Molyneux.

	Jon Entine

	...The most frequently heard reason for this pattern by skeptics, including many scientists, is that Rift Valley Kenyans and Jamaican athletes just work harder at running. They had to run back and forth to school. It’s a way out of often deplorable poverty. There are in fact some cultural factors in play, just as there are cultural reasons for why Dominicans excel in baseball. In the case of Jamaica, the British introduced organized and informal athletics, and interscholastic competition, to the island and other colonies in the late 19th century, and running was the central sport--sprints and long distance.

	...Blacks still find it difficult to break into many specialized or country-club sports, like bobsledding or golf, in which equipment costs are steep.


https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/04/01/think-eugenics-discredited-practice-think-back/
	You think "eugenics" is a discredited practice? Think again, it's back.

	Jon Entine

	...My concern is that the CCDC’s framing of the issue undermines support for genetic testing, particularly before conception. Lewis, Reiskin and a slew of commentators regularly deploy the word “eugenics” as if it’s a synonym for genocide.

	...Eugenics is typically portrayed as morally repugnant by today’s standards. But eugenics (meaning simply “good genes”) has its roots in the progressive era at the turn of the twentieth century

	...Scientists offered what they considered to be a progressive solution: “positive eugenics,” which focused on better pre-natal and natal and health care and encouraged society’s healthiest citizens to have more children. The founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, along with many major Protestant and Jewish clergy, were eager proponents of positive eugenics.

	...By the 1930s ideologues of the far right twisted eugenics to justify Nazism and genocide. Their exploitation of the practices led to the now widely accepted view that the “eugenics movement” as a whole was intrinsically evil and inhumane,

	...Modern eugenic aspirations are not about the draconian top-down measures promoted by the Nazis and their ilk. Instead of being driven by a desire to “improve” the species, new eugenics is driven by our personal desire to be as healthy, intelligent and fit as possible—and for the opportunity of our children to be so as well. And that’s not something that should be restricted lightly.

	Race in medicine
	Jon Entine

	Biopolitical Times, an online publication of the Center for Genetics and Society, rekindled the debate over race with a recent commentary by Jessica Cussins on the value of the concept in medicine. Although not as biased in its coverage of genetics as anti-biotech campaigners and such groups as the ill-named Council for Responsible Genetics, it is known for its selective analysis of hot button genetics issues, the validity of the race concept among them.

	Cussins stumbled out of the gate, writing that the “legitimacy of race as a biological concept has been largely discredited,” but offering no links to support that contention. The best Cussins can muster is an unlinked quote from a college student. Yet, as she notes in the very same sentence, racial categories (often as crude proxies for genetic differences between populations) are currently ubiquitous in medicine and medical research.”

	Are research scientists just not as smart as Cussins? Are they just stubborn, hanging onto outdated and dangerous ideas?

By my best guess, "race realism" is a way for them to foment more racial conflict, mostly under the guise of "just having a discussion" about the "science" of racial differences in intelligence.

	Bell Curve redux: Is the science of intelligence too taboo to research?
	David Warmflash | June 6, 2017 |

	...It should be possible to accept this idea, as we accept it when it comes to height, athletic ability, risk for specific diseases, and so many other traits. Doing so, whether or not one is convinced by the math of The Bell Curve, Harris has noted that it would be surprising if such a trait were identical between any groups of humans that have been reproductively isolated, including the groupings of that have come to be known as races.

	...Second, with the brain-relevant genetic data coming in, there are bound to be surprises. Indeed, we have had some already, such as the finding that Caucasians and Asians have significant amounts of Neanderthal genetic sequences, whereas sub-Saharan Africans have almost none.

	...So what role does genetics play in determining mathematical aptitude? You can find articles claiming that genes account for 40 percent, 50 percent or even 75 percent. They're all based on valid studies seeking to determine how much is nature versus nurture. That may sound trite, but it's just the way things are.

	...Having a good math teacher and an encouraging environment are important, but the nurturing element also needs adequate starting material. Genetics underlies brain structure. And the details of that structure dictate all abilities, including those in the mathematical realm.

	David Warmflash 

	In discussing the idea in his work Daedalus–a reference to the inventor in Greek mythology who, through his inventions, strived to bring humans to the level of the gods–Haldane was diving into issues of his time, namely eugenics and the first widespread debates over contraception and population control.

	Whether Haldane's view will prove correct about the specific timing of when ectogenesis might become popular, or the numbers of children born that way, it’s certain that he was correct that tAt the same time, he was right that the societal implications are sure to be significant as the age of motherless birth approaches.

	...Once that happens, there will be no obstacle against pushing the limit further, toward full ectogenesis.

	...An artificial womb may sound futuristic, and in Haldane’s time this may have supported a perception that realizing the technology would go together with controlling the birth rate and eugenics controlling which humans come to life, and thus which genetic traits get passed down to future populations. But today, we could do these things without ectogenesis. We have plenty of contraceptive methods and can sterilize people, or make them more fertile, while pregnancies can be induced with implanted embryos made with in vitro fertilization.

	If anyone is working on a eugenics program at present, they can use surrogate mothers and don’t really require an artificial uterus--unless, we imagine a society that routinely, forcefully sterilizes all females

	Can't have a baby? Is choosing your child's genetic parents' characteristics racism, vanity or eugenics?
	David Warmflash

	...Last year, a lesbian couple--a white lesbian couple--sued a sperm bank for inadvertently getting the mother pregnant with sperm from an African American donor. The Ohio couple, Jennifer Cramblett and Amanda Zinkon, have a healthy toddler, but the mothers are worried about how the child will be treated by the extended family in their very un-diverse, rural community.

	Are Cramblett and Zinkon 'racist' for being upset about having a black child?

	...Is it wrong that a parent is concerned whether her child is of another race? That's a hard argument to  make. We would have to assume were are somewhat biologically programmed to want to raise biological children who look like us. Racial  thinking looks as though it will continue to be a factor in the business of donated sperm, eggs and genes.

	...An age of eugenics?

	Not only are women and couples choosing the genetic parents of their children based on ethnicity, many also select donors based on characteristics that many would say are superficial. A story in Slate Magazine found that many couples are requesting donors that are athletic and good looking.

	...From the Slate article, it's not clear whether the ambitious parents ever got the green-eyed, Swedish, Ivy League athlete they wanted, but apparently, at Yale University, a non-smoking female student can expect to earn up to $25,000 for her eggs, if donating them leads to a successful pregnancy--provided she scored at least 1500 on her SATs, which is pretty common at Yale.

	Obviously, the more desirable attributes that are to be included in a designer baby, the higher the cost. This, in turn, suggests that a money-driven eugenics trend could be on the horizon, with people who can afford it rearing a higher number of valedictorian NCAA champions than people who produce such children with no fertility aid. That may worry a lot of people [link to "Designer babies? It looks like racism and eugenics to me"], though others may see it merely as a new and entirely understandable trend.

TODO: figure out how to sum up article, weird like he keeps skirting around endorsing eugenics

also weird that he seems exceited about artificial wombs

I guess the problem of humanities evolution is something he thinks about a lot

another article by him and someone else on that here:

https://www.visionlearning.com/en/library/Biology/2/Future%20of%20Human%20Evolution/259
	Due to the marginalization of natural selection, futurists often predict that humans will not evolve more in any major way. These include high-profile science figures such as Sir David Attenborough, and even some biologists, such as Professor Steve Jones of University College London, who have said that "evolution is over" for humans, at least in the developed West. Another researcher, Peter Ward, a paleontologist at the University of Washington has written, "I don't think we are going to see any changes - apart from ones we deliberately introduce ourselves, when we start to bio-engineer people, by introducing genes into their bodies, so they live longer or are stronger and healthier."

	This idea certainly would be true, were natural selection inserted in place of evolution. Natural selection won’t provide us bigger brains, webbed hands or feet, or improvements in vision or hearing. This is because people who are exceptionally intelligent, have slight webbing in their hands, or have impressive hearing or vision ability end up having the same chance of having children as anyone else. Nearly everyone lives to reproductive age and the decision to have children or not is largely independent of physical health or prowess, and that’s why natural selective forces no longer operate on most of the human population.

	...Darwin did not know about genes, but careful, detailed observations during his famous voyage on the Beagle led him to make observations of phenomena that were consistent with the idea that traits somehow were transferred from generation to generation. One observation that Darwin made was that in each generation more offspring were born than could possibly survive. In nature, many that are born to parents simply do not survive to maturity, but this was also a reality for humanity until very recently. Consider families living right here in North America around the turn of the 20th century. Particularly in urban areas, such as New York City, where immigrants were arriving in droves. Couples had many children intentionally, expecting that some would die of diphtheria, measles, polio –any one of a plethora of communicable diseases. This was a typical way that people used to die, but did their deaths lead the survivors to evolve some resistance to these diseases through natural selection? It’s hard to know because within a generation or two there were vaccines for all of these diseases, so the population was immunized artificially.

	Evolution debate: Are humans continuing to evolve?
	David Warmflash 

	...This is the boring scenario, so we'll get it out of the way first. While death before reproduction is an effective tool for culling out undesirable traits, there is a flip side to the equation. In the Stone Age, being less intelligent than one's peers would put an individual at higher risk of premature death -- by animal attack, for instance. But natural selection also promoted the development of valuable traits. Our smarter ancestors could hunt better and find more food -- leading to the development of farming and a host of other advances that enabled them to stay alive and reproduce.

	But then a strange thing happened. Human society developed a sense of ethics and justice that led us to protect the weak. Today, we heal the sick. Infant mortality is low. And children of low intelligence are put into special education classes. As a result, many individuals who would have been weeded out in the Stone Age are growing up to pass on their genes.

	...Scenario II: Natural selection continues

	...The main argument here is that currently we're in a peaceful time, biologically speaking. Yet we could be on the verge of disease pandemics causing a Darwinian selective sieve. The jet-set age -- the very factor underlying the gene flow that's blending human races -- also can be a driving factor for the spread of a pandemic. The notorious influenza epidemic of 1918 came right at the end of  World War I, claiming more lives than battlefield injuries. Today, we are much better at monitoring infectious disease threats -- the containment of the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa is one example -- but we also have a growing human population.

	...Scenario III:  Evolution shifts to off-world human colonies

	...Scenario IV: Transhumanism will drive evolution

	We're already seeing humans using gene therapy to alter their genes. Transhumanists seek to change themselves through a range of technologies, including robotics, bionics, computer mind uploading, artificial wombs and genome editing. These technologies are potentially strong enough to give humans the power to essentially take over their own evolution.

	The Concept of the 'New Soviet Man' As a Eugenic Project: Eugenics in Soviet Russia after World War II 

	....The history of the Russian and Soviet eugenic movement1 covers a short period of time between late 19th century until the II World War and the abolition of genetics – as a “bourgeois science” in the Soviet Union. Despite its rather short outbreak, Russian and Soviet eugenicists were able to develop a unique understanding of how to better the human population. Outlawing genetics in Soviet Russia is – generally – perceived as the end of the history of Soviet eugenics movement (see: Krementsov 1996, 2011; Spektorowski 2004, and other). In this article, I wish to defended a thesis suggesting that – despite formally denying any affiliation to eugenics – the Stalinist effort to “breed a new, better man” was a vast eugenic programme, though lacking a regular institutional basis, similar to those of West European countries.

	...While the romantic numskulls of Nazi Germany are dreaming of restoring the old race of Europe’s Dark Forest to its original purity, or rather its original filth, you Americans, after taking a firm grip on your economic machinery and your culture, will apply genuine scientific methods to the problem of eugenics. Within a century, out of your melting pot of races there will come a new breed of men – the first worthy of the name of Man.



I think there is an ideology/philosophy that goes something like this: starting wars, famine, and disease is good because it kills off the "unfit" and accelerates evolution. Some commenter on reddit reffered to it to justify Putin starting opioid crisis in Russia. I think some in German high command in WWI followed similar philosophy.

It looks like Warmflash thinks this way or believes in this kind of philosophy from his writings. The idea that starting wars/disease advances the human race would be useful for giving psychopaths justification for starting wars, diseases, terrorist attacks, famine, as seen in Okhrana operations. Things like great chinese famine, holodomor, Lysenkoism don't make much sense but could make sense if done by someone who believes in "accerating evolution" this way.


this says Moltke was a "social darwinist:"

"in defence of war" talks about German gov's thinking in starting the war

might be propaganda targetting Germans specifically, especially post-WW2 with Hitler being social darwinist

but could be true anyway--Bolsheviks social darwinists?

good article on the evolution of these ideas

here Alfred Russel Wallace says he got the idea that "war, famine, and disease" help natural selection from Malthus then mailed his idea to Darwin
