	In 1860, the total free population of the United States and its territories was 27,489,561. A total of 393,975 people owned 3,953,760 slaves. That's 1.4% of the population that owned slaves, with an average of 10 slaves per owner.

	However, if you exclude the North where slavery was illegal and just look at the states where it was allowed, you have 393,975 people in the southern United States owning 3,950,546 slaves, out of a total non-slave population of 8,280,490. That's 4.8%, or one in twenty.

	Also, note that the total number of households in the Southern states was 1,466,192. If we assume that all the slaves in a household were owned in the name of the property owner — which is probably not 100% true, but close enough to give a good idea — then 27% of the households in the South owned slaves. So roughly one in four.

	This percentage varied by area: in Mississippi 49% of white families owned slaves whereas in Maryland only 12% of them did so.

	Using Census data to research his book, Glatthaar calculated that 4.9 percent of people in the slaveholding states owned slaves, that 19.9 percent of family units in those states owned slaves, and that 24.9 percent of households owned slaves. (Households are a broader category than families.)

	...State-by-state figures show some variation. In Mississippi, 49 percent of families owned slaves, and in South Carolina, 46 percent did. In border states, the percentage was lower -- 3 percent in Delaware and 12 percent in Maryland. The median for slaveholding states was about 27 percent.

	The eleven states of the CSA, in order of secession, were: South Carolina (seceded December 20, 1860), Mississippi (seceded January 9, 1861), Florida (seceded January 10, 1861), Alabama (seceded January 11, 1861), Georgia (seceded January 19, 1861), Louisiana (seceded January 26, 1861), Texas (seceded February 1, 1861), Virginia (seceded April 17, 1861), Arkansas (seceded May 6, 1861), North Carolina (seceded May 20, 1861), and Tennessee (seceded June 8, 1861). Secession was declared by pro-Confederate governments in Missouri and Kentucky (see Confederate government of Missouri and Confederate government of Kentucky), but did not become effective as it was opposed by their pro-Union state governments.

Texas (largest state?) was at 28%

	CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, a breakaway slaveholding republic founded in February 1861 after the secession from the Union of the lower South states. It originally comprised seven states (South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas) but gained four additional members from the upper South (Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina) in the wake of President Abraham Lincoln's decision to force the seceded states back into the Union after the attack on Fort Sumter in April.

Maryland and Deleware don't fit in

	Just because a right is not mentioned in the Bill of Rights, though, does not mean that the government automatically has the right to interfere with it. Instead, the 9th Amendment says that any right not enumerated, or listed, in the Constitution is still retained by the people. So, in plain language, it means that there are other rights that people have that are not listed in the Constitution.

	The Founding Fathers realized that they could not possibly list every natural right of human beings that needed protection. Instead, they delegated certain powers to the government that were specifically spelled out in the Constitution, and said everything else is left up to individuals and to their state governments.

	What is a natural right? Natural rights are those rights that people have just because they are human. They are natural to mankind and should not be violated by the government. So, things like freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, were judged by the Founding Fathers, to be natural rights that the government can not violate.

	Given its role in preserving states’ retained rights, the Ninth Amendment inevitably became entangled with the struggle over the southern institution of slavery. Both slave and free states attempted to use the Ninth Amendment to defend local regulations regarding slavery. No one, however, attempted to use the Ninth as a source of individual rights on behalf of the enslaved.

	...In 1856, having been elevated to Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, Bartley repeated his view that the Ninth Amendment protected the right of the states to maintain the peculiar institution of slavery.

	...Protecting state autonomy, however , inexorably led to the legal entrenchment of slavery. In Willis v. Jolliffee , a certain E.W. took one of his slaves, Amy, and her seven children to Ohio with the intention of setting them free. 204 His will dictated that his estate was to be executed in trust for Amy and her children. 205 Tragically, E.W. died the moment he arrived with Amy and her children at the wharf in Cincinnati. 206 Not having yet been freed, Amy remained a slave under South Carolina law and, according to the trial court, Amy could not inherit E.W.’s estate. 207 The opinion cited number of constitutional provisions, including the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, in support of its conclu sion that the Constitution anticipated state recognition of slavery as a “property” right. 208

	...Supreme Court Justice John Campbell took a similar view in his concurring opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford.209 In Dred Scott, the Supreme Court struck down the Missouri Compromise on the ground that Congress had no authority to ban slavery from the territories. One of the issues in the case was the scope of power delegated by the provision permitting Congress “to dispose of and to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.”210 The Government argued that “all” meant all and that it “include[d] all subjects of legislation in the territory.”211 Campbell’s response was that such a construction of congressional power would destroy the concept of limited enumerated power expressed by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments.

	...Abolitionists, for example, had long called for a reevaluation and a broadening of individual liberty, 230 but they ignored the Ninth Amendment as either a source of rights or as textual support for additional individual rights. 231 If the Ninth had been considered even indirect support for individual rights against the states, then its omission from abolitionist arguments is inexplicable. Of all pe ople in antebellum America, abolitionists had the greatest incentive to use ev ery possible constitutional argument available in the cause against slavery. In fact, abolitionists relied on the Declaration of Independence, natural law, biblical exegesis, common law, as well as a libertarian reading of most of the Bill of Rights; 232 they relied on almost *everything* except the Ninth Amendment. 233
