	Remembering the principles which actuated the founds of our government, and which for more than a half century were enforced, and then glancing at the events of the last six years, it does appear that there are irresistible evidences to establish the fact that a conspiracy exists to spread slavery all over this free nation. It is no idle fancy which causes Mr. Lincoln to make the charge that three of these important steps have already been taken, and that the fourth and final one only awaits the apathy and indifference or acquiesence of the people, to be consumated.

	We ask the attention of our readers to the manner in which Mr. Lincoln treats of this conspiracy--this design to nationalize slavery. We have not the space for the whole speech on this subject, at Springfield, and it may, therefore, from the extracts, lose some of its force:

	"The new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the States by State Consitutions, and from most of the National Territory by Congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced the struggle which ended in repealing that COngressional prohibition. This opened all the *national territory* to slavery, and was the *first point gained.*"
