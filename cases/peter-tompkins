	For nearly ten months, until the summer of 1944, U.S. Army commanders in Italy failed to understand how best to use the men of Donovan’s organization, because many of the professional soldiers still viewed them with a mixture of jealousy and contempt as privileged but naïve amateurs. As Peter Tompkins, the highly successful SI agent in Tome, recalled bitterly, “Unfortunately, despite the fact that we had been at war over two years, the OSS had been granted little opportunity by field commanders to prove itself an effective weapon of espionage and sabotage behind the enemy lines; most of us were still being frowned on by the brass as a collection of madmen.

	In early October, a group of antifascist exiles returned to Italy. They collaborated with Raimondo Craveri, a leading member of the Action party, and Bendetto Croce. They fashioned a proposal that would create the National Liberation Front an independent unit of Italian volunteers that would fight with the Allies.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Giglio
	Maurizio Giglio (20 December 1920 - 24 March 1944) was an Italian soldier and policeman. In September 1943, during World War II, the Italian government concluded an armistice with the Allies. He thereafter transmitted military intelligence by radio from Rome about the Nazi forces there to the Allied forces advancing through southern Italy.

	...On 3 September 1943, Italy and the Allies signed the Armistice of Cassibile. Nazi Germany did not learn of it until 8 September, when news of it was broadcast by Allied radio stations. The Germans retaliated by immediately putting into effect a pre-arranged plan for the forcible disarmament of Italian forces, codenamed Operation Achse. They invaded Rome, capital of their former ally. The Italians resisted. Giglio took part in the fighting, leading both his own soldiers and armed civilians, at Porta San Paolo. On 10 September, the Germans occupied Rome.

	On 17 September, Giglio left Rome with the intention of offering his military services to the Allies. On 4 October, he managed to pass through the fighting line and to contact an American patrol near Benevento (210 km (130 mi) from Rome). On 7 October, he arrived in Naples; where he was debriefed by the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS), who saw his potential as a secret agent. After a short period of training, on 28 October he passed through the lines in the reverse direction, equipped with a radio transmitter, a cipher book, and the code name "Cervo" (Italian for "deer").

	The police officer, once I was capable of looking beyond his uniform, I saw to be a pale but sturdy young man in his twenties, called Maurizio Giglio, with the code name of “Cervo” or stag; it was he, I gathered, who had brought the Vittoria radio up from Naples and now took care of moving it about.

	...Of the lot, the only one I trusted immediately was Franco, and possibly Cervo, the policeman, for he sided openly with Franco. 

	Despite my misgivings it was time to get down to business; so I informed them there was to be an Allied landing somewhere along the coast, but that for security reasons I could not tell them the exact time or location other than that we would have to act quickly if we were to be of serious assistance to the landing, either through paramilitary operations, sabotage, the saving of installations mined by the Germans, or the gathering of intelligence. 


https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128
	Two days after the landing, the OSS agent Peter Tompkins came to Rome to establish radio contact between the Resistance and the Allies: "The order was to prepare the insurrection


https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.461206/2015.461206.A-Spy_djvu.txt
	...Since that wasted opportunity in 1943 the Italian armed forces had crumbled into civilian life or into the ranks of Mussolini’s neo-Fascist army under General Graziani, and little or nothing had been done in the way of serious partisan activities or sabotage behind the German lines.

	Having agreed to the essential meeting for the next day I could see from the fading light that my first day in Rome was coming to an end. Topolino offered to put me up, saying he had a room and a pair of pajamas that might fit, but Cervo, the young policeman, interrupted with the suggestion that it would be safer for all concerned if I stayed a. his apartment. “Who,’' he asked with a smile, “would expect to find an American OSS agent in a Fascist policeman’s bed!”

	I was doubtful about making another move, especially as there were only a few" minutes before the six o’clock curfew — when all but Ger- mans and authorized personnel had to be off the blacked-out streets of Rome — and I knew that my papers were inadequate for crashing such a curfew. But I sensed a sort of undercurrent struggle between the agents, and Cervo finally convinced me by saying it would save me an extra trip the following morning when I was to ride to the meeting with the resistance leaders on the back of his policeman’s motorcycle.


https://books.google.com/books?id=83aMqklUijYC&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80
	When Allied headquarters supported Bourgion's position, Tompkins and his friend Craveri hit upon a plan. They formed a secret espionage corps to formalize OSS aid to anti-fascists of the Committees of National Liberation. This new group, the Organizazione della Resistenza Italiani (ORI), absorbed many of the group of radio operators from Royal Italian submarines lying idle in the harbor of Naples. The Craveri group remained a secret--from the Germans, from the Badoglio Government, from Colonel Huntington, and from the Corvo section at Algiers.

	Tompkins agreed to maintain and supply Craveri's agents and to infiltrate them into the north to work with the partisans in collecting and transmitting military intelligence. In return, Craveri would have the use of these men for his own political purposes


https://books.google.com/books?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&pg=PT137&lpg=PT137
	Nevertheless, Tompkins managed to get approval from his commanding officer, Colonel Ellery Huntington, long close to Donovan, to recruit and train Italians for deployment in occupied Italy as operatives of the plan. Opposition rose at once. Tompkins and Craveri had placed their projected movement precisely in the forefront of those "Leftish" registers whom Churchill himself opposed


https://books.google.com/books?id=nGLcu_QQB6cC&pg=PA166&lpg=166
	Tompkins met with Saragat and Pietro Nenni. They worked out an arrangement to make available most of their military underground in Rome for intelligence gathering purposes. The new organization headed by Malfatti, was called the Socialist Intelligence Service (SIS). ...The Socialst party was "a mass movement they had eyes and ears practically in every office, at every street corner, in the farms and villages between Rome and the beachhead ... they were organized, and their system of organization, from cell to section to center, mean not only optimum security, but established channels of communication."

	Tompkins was able to persuade the Military Front and others in the resistance to send all intelligence they obtained to the SIS. ..."There was virtually no government office in the city--from the old ministries to the municipal garbage collectors--in which we did not have a man, either a Socialist or a member of one of the partisan groups." ...Malfatti and Tompkins had an agent in the Fascist censorship office, and the Fascist counterespionage organization. ...Giglio was in a branch of the Fascist police and there was even a source in Kesselring's command.


https://books.google.com/books?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&pg=PT135&lpg=PT135
	OSS procedure at the outset, described in a recently declassified report, was to recruit local anti-Fascists from the villages along the front. Often, they were taken on in the afternoon, given need-to-know only training, and dispatched the same night with a return rendezvous for a debriefing at dawn. According to Tompkins, these incursions into German-occupied territory bordered on suicide missions. Getting caught in the act meant "shot on the spot--such being the case all too frequently"--or harsh interrogation. "We also had to be careful not to recruit those already working for a similar, perhaps more efficient German operations aimed at fingering our men to the SS."


https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128
	...The euphoria over the Allied landing relaxed security. "We had thought that the Allies were coming and the underground groups took risks, came in the open to do actions...And many were arrested" (Mario Fiorentini). But the Allies were held back, the Germans counterattacked, the front was stalled, and the Nazis regained control of the city.

	...The Stall at the front and the stepping up of repression caused a crisis in the Resistance. The military front was scattered. ...The intelligence work continued, but in the middle of March the Koch gang broke Peter Tompkins's group, which had been signaling German movements and directing air raids via radio. Of its members, Arrigo Paladini and Giuliano Vassalli were imprisoned and tortured at via Tasso; Luigi Mastrogiacomo and Maurizio Giglio would be killed at the Fosse Ardeatine. "Maurizio Giglio really gave his life for mine. He could heave easily saved himself, and yet he chose to be tortured, to be killed at the Fosse Ardeatine" (Peter Tompkins).


https://books.google.com/books?id=HghXabYoXfAC&pg=PA376&lpg=PA376
	Tompkins learned that Cervo, the twenty-three-year-old policeman-partisan on whose motorcycle he had frequently been transported to safety, had been betrayed. Captured by the Fascists as he tried to save Tompkin's radio transmitter, he was taken not to Via Tasso but to another torture chamber near the railroad station. Tompkins and his closest Italian collaborator, Franco, immediately planned an operation to rescue him. Then the incident of Via Rasella occured.


https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128
	"After the half failure of the landing at Anzio, the Allies urged the partisans to do something. This is very important. Not that I want to give the Allies the responsibility for what happened in via Rasella; but it's a fact that there was pressure from them" to attack the Germans behind the lines in occupied Rome.


https://books.google.com/books?id=nGLcu_QQB6cC&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216
	Peter Tompkins learned about the Via Rasella attack that evening. At first he thought that there was no point to the attack. "Why hadn't whoever was responsible for the attack risked his courage against Via Tasso, or picked off Kappler and his gang of butchers? Now there was no telling what the German action might be; certainly it boded no good for the underground in the city. What saddened us even more was to contemplate the beauty and precision of the attack and the organization of which appeared to have been damned near perfect."


https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134
	Franca Calamendrei took off his cap: it was the signal to light the fuse.

	...As they came up the street, the Germans again started to sing; children followed after them. Liana Gigliozzi recalls "...'Go away, children,' they told us. Somebody pushed me, they threw us, my brother and me, into a shoemaker's shop" around the corner.

	...Halfway up via Rasella, another child was not as lucky. Probably, while Bentivegna was walking away toward via Quattro Fontane (with his back to the cart), 11-year old Piero Zucheretti turned the corner of via del Boccaccio close to where the cart stood. His body would be found in pieces, next to another body that was never identified, either another victim of the bomb or the random fire of the Germans.

	..."At gunpoint, they lined us up all the way to via Quattro Fontane in front of Palazzo Barberini," says Guido Mariti; "Kapper told us: 'Comrades kaputt, you kaputt.' But he also told us that we would be freed if the perpetrator of the attack had come out." No one else remembers any such words, nor did Kappler ever claim that he said them ...The other prisoners remember only shouts, orders and threats; other witnesses saw men beaten with rifle butts, women grabbed and hit with fists by German troopers and high-ranking officers.


https://books.google.com/books?id=nGLcu_QQB6cC&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216
	Shouldn't Tompkins have attempted to attack the Pensione Oltremare? Tompkins came to this realization on the March 23 too late to save Giglio and the others. There was the possibility of using the apartment directly below Koch's prison. Dynamite could have been planted that would "collapse the floor of the apartment above. In the ensuing confusion we would stand a better chance of overcoming the guards and freeing prisoners." That opportunity would not present itself again. Jane Scrivener's diary entry of March 23 was written with a sense of foreboding: "No one know what the consequences will be, nor what horrible reprisals will follow."

	Thursday March 23rd

	...At half past three this afternoon, while a detachment of German troops was passing down Via Rasella, a time bomb which had been concealed in a dustman's cart exploded. Twenty-six Germans were killed and about twenty wounded; eight of them so seriously that they died shortly afterward. Pandemonium followed. Until 9 P.M. German sol- diers, S.S. men and Fascists with tanks and machine guns, con- tinued shooting wildly at the windows and roofs of houses not only in Via Rasella, but in the neighbouring streets also, All the inhabitants of Via Rasella as well as those who happened to be passing at the time were arrested, hustled into lorries and taken to what is now called "the slaughter house" at Via Tasso, the Gestapo prison and place of torture.

	No one knows what the consequences of this will be, nor what horrible reprisals will follow.

	Friday March 24th

	Another turn of the screw by the Germans. With explanations how it is absolutely necessary on account of the numbers of refugees in the city, how a more even distribution of avail- able supplies will thus be made, and that it is just for the time being, the already meagre ration of bread, 150 grammes, as from Saturday, the 25th, will be reduced to 100 grammes per head, per day. 

	...This evening the Qsservatore Romano appealed to all Romans to refrain from acts of violence in this most serious period of the war; acts, it says, which would only provoke severe reprisals, giving rise to an infinite series of painful episodes. It concludes by begging the clergy and all those who can influence the people to persuade them to be strong, patient and self-controlled, for their own sakes and for that of their city.

	The writer of this short appeal (published on the front page in italics) must already know something of the consequences of yesterday's occurrences in Via Rasella. Perhaps we shall know tomorrow.

	Saturday March 25th 

	Yes, we do know not only something but a great deal about the consequences of what happened in Via Rasella. Comment is superfluous. The story is a terrible one. No allusion has been made to it in the German-controlled press, but we have had all the facts from a trustworthy source. 

	At 2 o'clock yesterday the Gernians went to the prison of Regina Coeli, and called a long list of prisoners from the "third wing"; that is, the political wards. Some had been there for months, some for a few days; their only crime was that of being anti-Fascists. "With their hands tied behind their backs they were taken by lorry to some caves on the Via Ardeatina known as the Caves of Domitilla, as they are near the catacomb of that name. The Germans surrounded them with machine guns and tanks, and when at 3 o'clock the lorries drove up, the men in them were forced to alight and enter the caves. Once inside they were made to stand in groups of ten, and were machine- gunned. They were killed like cattle, with no priest present to help them at the end, no opportunity of communicating with their families. The bodies were piled in a long mound in the cave, and a mine was exploded at the entrance so that there could be no access to it. A priest and a few peasants, hidden in a neighbouring cottage which the Germans omitted to search, witnessed the proceedings. 

	Today's papers publish a communique from the German High Command which runs: 

		On the afternoon of March 23rd, criminal elements committed acts of violence by means of bombs against a German column passing through Via Rasella. In . consequence, thirty-two members of the German police were killed and a number of them wounded. 

		This brutally violent act was committed by communists of Badoglio's party. Investigations are being made as to the crime being caused by Anglo-American influence. 


https://books.google.com/books?id=HghXabYoXfAC&pg=PA376&lpg=PA376
	On the twenty-fifth Tompkins heard the romor that 320 hostages had been shot. Shortly afterward Franco arrived to tell him that one of the dead within the caves at Via Adeatina was certainly Cervo. From Cervo's orderly, who had "miraculously" escaped, Tompkins and Franco receieved a detailed report of the prolonged tortures Cervo had endured before being carried away to what could only have been a welcome death. He remained silent to the end.


https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.461206/2015.461206.A-Spy_djvu.txt
	Upstairs, just as I was putting on the water for some tea. Franco arrived — bereft of his usual smile. 

	“Hello,” he said, not at all in his usual voice: then enunciated slowly: “They have shot Cervo. And eleven of our men.” 

	Only then did I notice how pale he was and that there were small bloodshot veins in his eyes. 

	“We will kill a lot of guilty Fascists,” he said, gripping my arm. 

	I nodded. “All who are guilty,” I said. But for some reason I could not feel sad or depressed, as if my emotions had been novocained. I was a little scared, but more than anything — horrible as it may seem upon analysis — relieved. Cervo’s death appeared to me to be a release for him from what must have been almost unbearable torture, for us from the constant fear that he might not be able to refrain from giving us away; and behind all this was the warm, glowing realization that a human being had achieved one of the highest peaks within his limits. 

	“How do you know?” was all I could bring myself to say.

	One wonders what the point of the massive executions was, considering that afterward the German High Command made only a brief announcement. In any case, there was not much resistance activity in Rome in the few weeks left before the arrival of American and other Allied troops. Note also that the entire tragedy might have been avoided by a rapid American advance on Rome. In January, 1944, when the Allies landed at Anzio, a bare thirty miles from Rome, they took the Germans so much by surprise that a single American jeep carrying a lieutenant and a driver easily made it into the capital and returned unscathed. Katz quotes Kesselring's chief of staff, General Siegfried Westphal, who later wrote that, for the Germans, this was a "breathtaking situation" in which "no one could have stopped a bold advance guard entering the Holy City." But the American commanders hesitated, and Kesselring rallied enough troops to counterattack.

why not rescue Cervo? Why did he get captured in the first place? Why attack random German soldiers instead of rescue when Cervo and others had been captured? Why did Germans execute the prisoners when they had nothing to do with the bombing?


Tompkins book suggest he's close to Cervo and Tompkins said to be reckless, so one guess is Tompkins told him something and he knew to much


https://books.google.com/books?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&pg=PT194&lpg=PT194&dq=Tompkins+rescue+Cervo+OR+Giglio&source=bl&ots=hlx7SDJIb1&sig=awBRAtQoR0xZhEdjqUG8V_qhqss&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEnPaQy_baAhXhlOAKHS5-CB4Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=Tompkins%20rescue%20Cervo%20OR%20Giglio&f=false
	Although drawn to the younger men, Giglio and Malfati--like him, both in their early twenties--Tompkins had to overcome strong misgivings to reveal to any of them that within hours there was to be an Allied landing. First, he declared that he was under the personal orders of General Donovan and, as such, was the chief of the OSS in Rome.


assuming collaboration, executions in general would be to clear out people who knew to much, hard to say what exactly would be worried about with Cervo, but intimate knowledge of details of what Tompkins did would be one thing


https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.461206/2015.461206.A-Spy_djvu.txt
	Furthermore, to perfect our security, there 
	should be certain places that each of us knew, but none that all of us 
	knew, so that, depending on who was caught, the survivors might have 
	a safe refuge and means of communication with the Allies. Of this 
	wc had a hard time convincing Cervo, who could not seem to under- 
	stand that there were things it was better he know nothing about, for 
	his own peace of mind as well as for ours. 1 suppose Franco, with 
	his political background, and I with the burnings I had received in 
	North Africa and southern Italy, owning to poor security among the 
	Allies, were instinctively inclined to overprecisc security, whereas Cervo, though courageous and loyal, seemed childishly brash in such 
	matters, seeming to think that if there was something we did not tell 
	him it was an indication we did not trust him. He could not under- 
	stand, though I tried desperately to convince him, that there were 
	things 1 told Franco that I did not tell Cervo, and things 1 told him 
	I did not tell Franco; that for there to be security each man should do 
	his own job and try to know as little as possible about everyone else, 
	or how they operated, because what you didn't know you couldn’t tell. 


	...As we discussed how' best to give assistance on the spot to such a 
	raid, the bell rang six times and Cervo came in in his usual excited 
	manner. 

	I was annoyed by his unexpected visit (they were becoming too fre- 
	quent for security, and his presence made Maria nervous), but this 
	time Cervo had some really w'orth-whilc problems to discuss.

	...At the usual place, by the Antici Mattei, instead of Cervo’s Topo- 
	lino as I had expected, Cervo was waiting with the old familiar motor- 
	cycle, and 1 thought to myself as I climbed on behind him, How many 
	more times will 1 have to ride this contraption before wc are through, 
	one way or the other? 


	...But though I went to sleep pleasantly, i was roused by a pounding 
	on the secret hatch — always a frightening experience, especially that 
	early in the morning. 

	It was Cervo. 'The Vittoria operator hasn’t been seen since last 
	night,” he explained all in one breath. “We’re worried something has 
	happened to him.” 

	“How the devil,” I asked, “could anything happen to him if he’s 
	been sitting in his apartment as ordered?” 


that's a good question...


	...Later in the evening Franco came in and I was so pleased to see 
	him 1 brought out the last bottle of gin from our makeshift cellar and 
	mixed some really stupendous martinis. As Maria was a little late 
	w'ith dinner we decided - o play a proper rubber of bridge — Baldo, Lele, 
	Franco and I. 

	Picking up a hand with a mess of hearts, I was about to bid when 
	the phone rang. Wc listened, ca^ds in hand, foi the four calls. It was 
	not a conventional ring, so we let it go. It continued, however, so per- 
	sistently that Maria, who had come up from the kitchen, picked up 
	the whole phone on its long extension and moved it through the door 
	into the big living room. Still it continued to ring. Finally, with a 
	frown. I nodded to Maria to answer. There was a pause, then she 
	poked her head round the door with a surprised look on her face. ’The 
	sister wants to know if 1 have bought her any honey! What shall 1 say?” 

	“Say that you will let her know,” J answered. 

	Maria did so, and hung up; but the others must have sensed that*" 
	something was wrong. They were all staring ai me apprehensively. 

	"They’ve got Cervo,” I said. “That was the conventional phrase.” 

	Immediately we began to clear the card table, remove the glasses, 
	put everything in order. 

	“But it can’t be anything,” said Maria. “The sister’s voice was so 
	calm and natural.” 

	“Perhaps it isn’t anything serious,” I answered. Then I began to 
	wonder if Cervo might have misunderstood the conventional phrase 
	and thought he was to mention the honey if everything were all right, 
	not if something were wrong. 

	I said so to the others, and it seemed to cheer them up. Then the 
	phone rang again, two and two — the danger signal — followed by 
	silence. 

	Looking around I saw that the others looked as frightened as I felt. 
	Franco glanced at his watch, and so did I. It was well past the curfew 
	hour. Debating what to do we went about systematically collecting and 
	burning and obliterating all evidence of our presence in the apartment. 

	There was no longer any doubt in our minds that something had 
	happened to Cervo, and there would be no way of knowing whether he 
	could resist under torture, and if so, for how long. In any case his 
	sister had the phone number of our apartment and through it our 
	address could be traced. We would have to get out, and fast.


	...It was almost dark, time for the curfew, when Franco arrived, 
	looking very perturbed. 

	“It’s bad,” he said, then took my arm. “Promise me one thing. 
	When the Allies come, don’t ever let them send such people behind 
	the lines again. Such swine! You know' what happened? That filthy 
	operator took the police to the spot where the radio was hidden on 
	the river boat and set a trap for Cervo. The operator squealed to save 
	himself. The rat^ As if they won’t shoot him just the same. . . . And 
	now poor Cervo’s caught!” 


	...As everyone sat round the fire I opened the first of four bottles of 
	good English gin wisely produced by Franco from his comucopial 
	brief case. Though we had nothing to mix with it we unanimously 
	proclaimed it good enough to be taken straight. To ease my nervous 
	tension and block out the thought of Cervo I led the way by drinking 
	a couple of long straight draughts.


	...It was a sunny Sunday afternoon — March 19, to be exact — as 
	Baldo and I walked along Via Panama toward Via Salaria, the air 
	faintly rcsincd by the tall umbrella pines, the streets crowded with 
	people, enjoying, or pretending to enjoy, those few hours of enforced 
	leisure, undisturbed by the manhunts of the Germans and the raids of 
	Allied planes. 

	As the clean fresh air cut through the mists of my hangover 1 was 
	able, for the first time since Franco had told me that Cervo had defi- 
	nitely been caught, to think about our problem. Did the Germans 
	have him? Or the Italians? And if so, where? Before any definite plans 
	could be made the answers to these questions would have to be 
	obtained. 


	...	As we sat there at a marble-topped table, watching the light begin 
	to fade, I felt more frightened and hopeless — despite the good white 
	wine — than I had ever before, and could not keep it out of my mind 
	that poor Cervo was caught, that the combined Italian and German 
	police would soon be scouring the city for us. The terror of being 
	hunted and the knowledge that if you are caught you will be horribly 
	tortured, perhaps for days, is a most unpleasant sensation. A specific 
	job, no matter how dangerous, can be worked up to, and the terror 
	mitigated by action and the knowledge that there will be an end, one 
	way or the other. But being hunted, with nothing you can do about 
	it, except jump at every sound, suspect everyone who looks at you, 
	and feel trapped no matter where you are, is a slow, steady form of 
	torture, worthy of the most fiendish of inventors. To cap it, the thought 
	that the Allies would not arrive for weeks, and that the torture, at 
	best, would drag on without respite, made the whole thing almost un- 
	bearable. 


	...The next day’s problems were finding out, if possible, the details 
	of Cervo’s capture, seeing whether the police had raided the Palazzo 
	Lovalelli, or Baldo’s apartment, and if Maria could find us some sort 
	of refuge for the coming night. 


	...Looking at my watch, and seeing that I still had an hour to wait 
	before my appointment, I decided that any risk was better in the dark 
	than on the open streets. People were moving round to better seats 
	or making for the exits. As we got to our former seats the sailor sud- 
	denly handed me my brief case, saying goodbye, that he had to leave. 1 
	was surprised but relieved. Now the film began to get on my nerves, 
	its familiar seenes mingling incongruously with images of the last 
	few days’ events and fantasies of what was happening to Cervo. 

	Then someone stood beside me. 

	I did not dare turn to look, but sat frozen, too terrified to tremble. 
	Whoever it was stood equally still. Even my imagination stopped. Then 
	I saw the shadow edging forward, dark Homburg, well cut dark blue 
	coat, unmistakably Cervo’s father. In my mind I unraveled the leason: 
	he had guaranteed to turn me over to the police if they would spare his 
	son. I wasn’t the least surprised he had tracked me to the theater; it had 
	been his specialty for twenty years, and this time the incentive was 
	clearly stronger. As he did not move, and I dared not turn my face 
	and thus reveal my features by the light of the screen, I sat immobile. 
	And still he did not budge. 

	Could he possibly miss me, nearsighted, unaccustomed to the dark- 
	ness? It was getting time for my appointment with the others. 11 I 
	were to miss them they would never find me, or I them. There 'was 
	nothing for it but to take the risk. With my heart in my mouth, I stood 
	up, ostentatiously blew my nose so as to cover my face, moved 
	rapidly toward the exit. 1 was sure now that the police were waiting for 
	me at the door, gun> pointed, car ready, and 1 hoped, though there 
	was little chance of it, they would fire on sight instead of carting me 
	off to endless torture.



Tompkins had met Cervo's father before. If Cervo's father was with the police, and Cervo was captured, why didn't they make the conenction and arrest Tompkins?


	...As I smiled, a little wryly, I managed at last to ask the question 
	that was weighing on my mind — and the one that had obviously 
	prompted their sortie: “What about Cervo?" 

	Franco shook his head. “He's not at Via Tasso. But we have some 
	news." 

	Franco then described how he u arranged a meeting between Maria 
	and Cervo’s sister in a nearby church which he had had surrounded 
	by plenty of guns. Maria had arrived dressed in mourning, heavily 
	veiled, Cervo’s sister had managed to come without being followed. In 
	a dark comer they had exchanged a few words. From Cervo’s sister 
	Maria learned that a police commissioner had phoned Cervo’s home 
	to say that Cervo was all right, and on duty out of town. The family 
	hadn’t fallen for this though, suspecting it to be a trick. Later they 
	had received a message in Cervo’s writing asking for bread and honey 
	and cigarettes. But as we all know he doesn’t smoke, and honey was 
	the conventional word through which we learned of his capture, the 
	family assumed the message to be a warning of danger. After that, 
	nothing more. Finally, Franco added, Cervo’s fiancee had left for 
	Bologna to see if she could get his father to help. 

	We were just then passing the moving picture theater where I 
	had spent the afternoon and 1 now wondered if the man I had seen 
	was really Cervo’s father, or just some figment of an overwrought 
	imagination! 

	One thing in Franco’s story appeared to be greatly in our favor. It 
	looked as if Cervo had been captured by an Italian counterpartisan 
	gang and that the Germans weren't yet in on the affair. It so, we might 
	stand a chance of organizing a rescuing raid. But for this we would 
	have to discover exactly where he was being held, and how h#avily he 
	was guarded. 


If they had a spy high up in police, why weren't they able to find out where Cervo was being held?


	...When it was time for her to go I held her hand tightly, kissed her on 
	the cheek and led her quickly to the door. She had been extremely 
	brave these last few days of trouble, but the strain was beginning to be 
	too much for her high-strung nature, and I realized that Franco had 
	not been exaggerating when he had said that after her meeting in the 
	church with Cervo’s sister she had danced through the streets half 
	laughing, half crying, uttering uncoordinated phrases, trying to buy a 
	horse and buggy and a bunch of flowers. 


	...But that, sad as it was, was not all the bad news of the day. We received more details of Cervo’s imprisonment thanks to the appear- 
	ance of a young boy at the home of Cervo’s parents. The boy had been 
	arrested with an old professor, blindfolded and taken to a strange 
	apartment full of frightful men and women. There he had heard people 
	howl and scream and had seen Cervo stripped of his lieutenant’s in- 
	signia, his face badly bruised and beaten, minus several teeth. He also 
	reported having seen Cervo’s orderly with him and that he too had 
	been beaten. The boy said that Cervo had begged him — ^were he to 
	manage to escape or be released — to go to his family. 

	Cervo’s mother and sister were afraid, however, that it might be a 
	trap; and we were inclined to agree. From the description of the 
	place we figured that poor Cervo must have fallen into the hands of 
	another bunch of brutes like Bardi and Pollastrini, the organizers of a 
	Fascist torture chamber in the Palazzo Braschi which had been 
	broken up as being too awful even for the Germans. 

	It was a relief though to know, pretty well for certain, that the Ger- 
	mans, as yet, had nothing to do with Cervo’s arrest, and that once 
	Franco’s men had carefully rcconnoitered the place we might pro- 
	ceed with our next operation of attempting to get him otit with an 
	armed coup de main. 


Big question of whole thing is why didn't Tompkins rescue Cervo? Despite intel capabilities, Tompkins says he concluded Cervo was in the wrong place or wasn't sure.

Tompkins got intel on Cervo's wherabouts March 22, writes in memiors inclined to agree it was a trap and concluded German's had nothing to do with his arrest.


	...The next morning, March 23, Franco reported that bis men had 
	located the place where Cervo was being kept a prisoner — an apart- 
	ment in a dismal gray building in one of the ugliest parts of Rome near 
	the Termini Station: Via Principe Amedeo 2. Since his men had been 
	watching they had seen what appeared to be three corpses taken from 
	the building, and neighbors complained of frightful screams and gun- 
	fire late into the night. 

	About a dozen men, well aimed with submachine guns, were re- 
	ported in and out of the apartment; to make a frontal assault would 
	be costly and almost certainly useless. Yet something must be done, 
	and soon, to liberate Cervo. 

	Finally we decided that if at any time there were less than fifteen 
	men in the apartment we would attempt a direct assault. Both Franco 
	and 1 felt we owed it to Cervo to be there personally when we tried to 
	pull it off. Meanwhile Franco had requested his men to discover what 
	was in the apartment immediately below the one in which Cervo was 
	being held. 

	Primo had managed to see Cervo’s sister (they lived almost across 
	the street) without being followed and had recovered four hundred 
	thousand lire from the runds hidden in Cervo’s house; with this we 
	could now pay the men ot the information service, who had been with- 
	out funds for se\cral days and in immediate danger of being picked up 
	by the police. 


According to Tompkins, got more intel morning of March 23 and convinced of Cervo's location. Tompkins writes a the place was guarded by "about a dozen men ... with submachine guns" and that a frontal assault would be costly and useless. But "finally decided" would attack if < 15 men (or I guess a different way, mentions scouting under apartment).

some of this doesn't add up -- in Tomkin's novella of his time in Rome, after Cervo capture a lot of ink on how worried if Cervo would give up their location, anxiety and moving around, cancelling things, afraid of capture. Then when he gets intel on Cervo first says "must be a trap" and then "it's too costly."


	In the evening, as 1 sat on the terrace watching the first of the swal- 
	lows, Lelc came rushing in, out of breath. Someone had thrown a 
	bomb or a series of bombs in a side street called Via Rasella (a narrow 
	street running steeply down from the Palazzo Barberini to the end of 
	the Traforo tunnel) and had killed about thirty German MPs. The 
	whole area was in a turmoil. German police and Fascists had opened 
	fire, and it was rumored that as many as 200 civilians had been in- 
	jured or killed in the shootings. The Fascists had then gone from 
	house to house beating anyone they could lay hands on, arresting all 
	men in the area, lining them up along the walls of buildings with their 
	arms above their heads, carting them off to jail irrespective of identity. 

	Our first reaction was that there was no point in killing thirty non- 
	descript German MPs! Why hadn’t whoever was responsible for the 
	attack risked his courage against Via Tasso, or picked off Kappler and 
	his gang of butchers? Now there was no telling what the German re- 
	action might be; certainly it boded no good for the underground in 
	the city. What saddened us even more was to contemplate the beauty 
	and precision of the attack the organization of which appeared to have 
	been damned near perfect! 

	The next afternoon, March 24, Franco had scheduled another of 
	our incongruous pastimes: a tea party at Baldo’s with the girls whom 
	we had invited the night of SS Captain Pricbke’s arrival. The purpose 
	of the party was to establish whether it was safe to reoccupy Baldo’s 
	flat, and to convince the superintendent of our purpose for doing so. 

	As usual I didn't feel like leaving the comfort and apparent security 
	of the flat 1 was in, but Franco insisted. So we set off about four in the 
	afternoon, loaded with good French brandy and a couple of dozen 
	pastries. Owing to the attack on Via Rasella there was a^rumor the 
	curfew had been advanced to 4 p.m. But there were still people on the 
	streets and we walked through Parioli undisturbed. 

	At Baldo’s I lit a lire with the only wood available; stray bits of 
	furniture and a washboard. The girls arrived and w^e sat around the 
	fire consuming tea and cakes and brandy. Soon 1 began to forget the 
	realities of the w^orld outside and enjoy the company of the girls, 
	especially the one called L., with whom 1 had been to fetch Captain 
	Priebkc, and who was now eyeing me curiously. 

	By seven o'clock, the proper curfew hour, we had perforce to part. I 
	was unwilling to, and Baldo and I decided to walk L. home — a risk we 
	should not have taken, but w^hich, with the aid of so much brandy so 
	early in the evening, I managed almost to enjoy.

	When at last we regained our own flat we discovered that the Ger- 
	mans had threatened to shoot three hundred hostages, ten for cuch 
	German soldier killed at Via Rasella the previous afternoon. Accord- 
	ing to rumor, there were 150 men available in the main jail and they 
	intended to take the rest wherever they could find them.

	From Sensi, the good Swiss nurse, we obtained, along with the latest 
	rumor, a small roast beef, which we washed down with a bottle of good 
	red wine while heatedly discussing the most effective way to get Cervo 
	out of the hands of the brigands who were holding him prisoner. 


	According to Franco's latest reports there were seldom less than 
	fifteen well-armed guards in or around the apartment at Via Principe 
	Amedeo 2, but one of Franco's men had discovered the apartment 
	beneath it to be empty. Franco had therefore planned for a partisan 
	locksmith to go there the next day, make an entry, and plant enough 
	dynamite to collapse the floor of the hall of the apartment above. In the 
	ensuing confusion we would stand a better chance of overcoming the 
	guards and freeing the prisoners. 

	The next morning, March 25, 1 had a hangover from the brandy 
	and good red wine; to ease it I drank several glasses of that appetizing 
	but nauseatingly labeled Roman beverage known as Acqua Marcia — 
	or Rotten Water. In the light of day, and without benefit of exhilarating 
	brandv, the operation to free Cervo seemed more problematical; 
	nevertheless it was the best that w’e could hope for. Franco w'as to 
	bring news of the hour and final disposition for the raid we were to 
	itage. 

	Late in the afternoon Lcle arrived with a rare delicacy: a pork 
	chop! — followed shortly by Maria with a small bunch ot flowers and 
	news of her own adventures during the last few days. 

	Still there was no sign of Franco. 

	Suddenly a fuse blew' and 1 was obliged to go down to the cellar, 
	where, with one of the refugees who lived on the giound floor, a lanky 
	fellow with a bastard hu iting dog, but a firsl-aitc electrician, we man- 
	aged to remedy the delect in one of the most prehistoric lighting sys- 
	tems ever installed in the twentieth century. 

	As we worked he informed nu he had just heard from the maid of 
	the bombed-out police commissioner who lived on the floor below us 
	the latest information on Via Rasella. 

	It was the first J had heard of any such person living below' us, and 
	my blood ran cold at the thought, only to be chilled even further as 1 
	heard the rumor that 320 hostages had been shot the previous after- 
	noon for the death of the thirty-two Germans killed at Via Rasella. 

	Upstairs, just as 1 was putting on the water for some tea. Franco 

	arrived — ^bereft of his usual smile. 

	“Hello,” he said, not at aU in his usual voice: then enunciated 

	slowly: “They have shot Cervo. And eleven of our men.” 

	Only then did I notice how pale he was and that there were small 
	bloodshot veins in his eyes. 

	“We will kill a lot of guilty Fascists,” he said, gripping my arm. 

	I nodded. “All who are guilty,” I said. But for some reason I 
	could not feci sad oi depressed, as if my emotions had been novo- 
	cained. 1 was a little scared, but more than anything — horiible as it 
	may seem upon analysis — relieved. Cervo’s death appeared to me to 
	be a release for him from what must have been almost unbearable tor> 
	ture, for us from the constant fear that he might not be able to refrain 
	from giving us away; and behind all this was the warm, glowing reali- 
	zation that a human being had achieved one of the highest peaks 
	within his limits. 

	“How do you know'?” was all T could bring myself to say. 

	Then Franco told me that a degraded lieutenant of the PS (Security 
	Police) had been seen at Regina Cocli too weak and too battered to 
	stand alone, and that he had been carried away with the others. 

	Having cleaned out Via Tasso the Germans had gone to Regina 
	Coeli and asked for 250 more men at random. Neither the prisoners 
	nor some of the authorities apparently knew that the merf were to be 
	shot, thinking they were to be taken to forced labor. Some asked to 
	take their canteen cups and blankets, and it w^as not till they were 
	loaded onto trucks, hands tied, wiih the Germans holding tommy guns 
	to their ribs that they realized what was in store for them. Some tried 
	to jump from the tiucks, but too late. They were rushed out to some 
	catacombs near San Callisto w'here they were thrown at random into 
	one of the caves and shot individually in the back of the neck, the living 
	climbing higher on the pile of dead. And when the dead and wounded 
	lay in a vast heap, the Germans exploded half a dozen mines, burying 
	the living and the dead under the collapsing cave. 

	Only later, from Cervo's orderly, w^ho was arrested with him but 
	miraculously escaped execution, we got the following full report of 
	what had happened to C ervo since the day, a week earlier, when he 
	had rushed out of the “hole” to move the radio by the river.



big question of all this is: why didn't Tompkins rescue Cervo, especially after Via Rasella?


"The girls arrived and w^e sat around the fire consuming tea and cakes and brandy. Soon 1 began to forget the  realities of the w^orld outside and enjoy the company of the girls" 

"According to Franco's latest reports there were seldom less than fifteen well-armed guards in or around the apartment"

"


his alibi: cakes, brandy, and girls made him forget, "seldeom less than fifteen" guards, hangover next morning, no "exhilerating brandy", had to change a lightbulb

how many agents did they have in German police?


https://books.google.com/books?id=8WHDVZPscVIC&pg=PT273&lpg=PT273
	In a new but temporary hideout with a view of the Borghese Gardens, Peter Tompkins on that evening of the 22nd received his first details of the fate of Cervo. Tompkins had been on the run for nearly a week, unable to communicate with OSS headquarters, and the only further word about Certo he had in the meantime was that Cervo had been betrayed by Radio Vittoria operator Bonocore. What else Bonocore knew and had surely divulged was a frightful mystery no less than Cervo's capacity to remain silent. Changing addresses almost nightly, the American took the name of Roberto Berlingieri, a nonexistent distant cousin to a Fascist noble family. He had the handmade Capri shoes and could affect the necessary Tuscan accent, and in that guise he had a chance encounter with someone who had had direct dealings with that family--Gestapo Captain Erich Priebke.

	Luck was on Tompkin's side, however, more than he knew. With Lele, he had gone to a crowded "curfew party"--a common all-night diversion in collaborationist. circles of occupied Rome. This one was at the Parioli home of film star Laura Nucci, whom he recognized from the images of her silver-screen persona. Wrapped in furs, she lay on a sofa in a far corner of the room under the ambitious hands of a dapper SS officer. It was not until the ntext day that Tompkins learned that the SS man was Priebke, Kappler's cheif of counterespionage, and still later of his Berlingieri connections. But the American was unnerved more than once during the evening by Priebke's intense stare. In the end, Priebke did nothing more than offer Tompkins his groping hand, click his heels while bowing slightly and take his leave, walking a drunken zigzag to the door.

	SUSSKIND: "When you become an intelligence operative, a spy, are there tests? Do you take vocational tests, did you, Mr. Tompkins?"

	TOMPKINS: "No, when I started there weren't any such things. I just had to go and practice by myself. And I used both forms of disguise. At times I tried to look as inconspicuous as possible. I had glasses that weren't really for reading, but they covered by face, and I wore the worst-looking clothes I could find. At other times I passed as a playboy with Caracono clothes. I did that, actually, with the chief of the opposition, the spy catcher, the German spy-catcher in Rome, the boad of the Zigurheistdionst (?), who knew my name and knew that I was in Rome running an intelligence service; but we spent the night couching and drinking and playboying, and he never knew for a second who I was."


	...SUSSKIND: "Well, in the more recent history of spying, would our government today -- the CIA -- would they give tests, would they make an efort to find out if a man was in chracter and temperment equipped?"

	FARGO: "Already, during the war, there was a tremendous assessment center."

	TOMPKINS: "It was very funny, you know, because the general, General Donovan, somebody said to him, why don't you make up a school to test who's good and hwo isn't for spies. And he said, alright, let there be such a place. And after the war I ran across a book in Columbia Univeristy library -- it fell off the shelf -- and I opened it up, and it was a book by the psychiatrist who had stared the school. And the opening paragraph is, I had no idea how to go about this. And as a matter of fact, when I came back from five years of war almost and five months behind the lines, I couldn't leave the country again to go on another assignment without having been put through one of those tests. And I flunked it completely. I needed a word from the General to say he can go, he's alright, but I flunked all of their silly test."


	...=MIND: "Can we establish whether or not spying is a perilous, dangerous, profession, death's looming possiblility, always?" TOluttiVIS: "Yes indeed, it was in my case all the time. Ent mine became a spying operation which started off really as an iaeel/igence operation. Just before the Anzio /endings General Donovan, who used to appear on the scene whenever anything al:citing was going to happen, said he wanted an intdlligence officer in Homo to coordinate Partisan activities and Gather intelligence. But, as you know, when we landed at Anzio, ,Ceneral Lucas, who was in commend, instead of taking advantage of the surprise with which we caught the Germane, and taking eefueed to move. And then they wanted to know exactly what the Germans were doing. "Koaeoleing changed his mind when he saw we werent advanoing and started to move hie troops to Wipe out the beachhead. Then my operation turned into a classic espionage operation. Bectuee they wanted to know every single thing they could about the Germane. 33I made contact with the peop/o in Rome who could do that, which were the various parties of the Committee of . National Liberation. And we set uo an organization to watch all the 'oads, so that all German traffic to the beachhead was • watched. And then, as things developed, we found a contact right inside German headquarters. So I was ab/e to radio by secret radio to the allbs on the beachhead each time the Germans were preparing for attack, where they were Going to attack, where they were going to feint and in what strength they were Going to attack. And this was going immediately to the beachhead, an hour, two hours, throe or four timee a day, sometimes 24 hoUre before on amok, 48 hours before an attack. And we had the intelligence straight from Hitler. Hitler was planning the three major attacks on the beachhead. Finally, the one on the 16th he was personally in command, down to practically platoon level, ok how that attack was going to be launched and carried out, But all the time we were radioing this directly to the beachhead, to the allies on the other side." 

	SUBSKIND: "Was your contact within the German headquarters a German?" TOIWREINS: "Actually, to be more precise, he was an Austrian." FARAGO: "Was his name Skokholz?" T OMealaS: "I have no idea what his name was, because I worked through a young man who was half Austrian and half Italian, and whose father was Austrian before; and he had many contacts among the 2ustrians who were in the Gorman Army. And to the Germans they wore secure, but of course, they weren g t, because they remembered."

	...SUSSMD: "Well, how do you account  for  our indignation? We act so moral and upright." TIMMINS: "TO a certain extont it shouldn e t be. But  on  the otlIcr hand I firmly believe that there is good and bad spying. And  if  thaw) is any purpose to this p/anqt at  all there is a moral purpoze. Aad there is in spying too. And you can Go just so  far and play the game and succeed.  If . you go one stop too far you vitiate your gene, dispel your whole promise and that's what I  call  bad spyang. "That's what the SD of the Germans did and that's what  Canaris, as hcad of the Abuthr, triad as best as he could not to do, Eou you can say there are bad Germans *  But there are differences otatcn tha Garmans. And the difference between Canaria and Rimier and Hoydriah and the SD's was quite a noticeable diffotonco."

	=SHIED: "Boos bad spying wort?" TOMINS: "Hew you may have quick successos with it, but I think  you're  doomed to disaster in the end.


	...USSKIND: "When a spy is caught  is  It generally because of his carelessness or because of betraYal by someone?" FELIX: "It  could be either. But  in most cases It's a simple wearing down of the laws of chance, which  are operating ineeorably against him. There 'a .  a literature on the sub Joe of how long an operation can be kept going without being Caught. And Sorge, the Russian spy in Japan -- Manchuria and Japan -- ran for nine years. This  is, I  think, a record." • Parago: "That was a very interesting operation too." TOMPKINS: •"Mbbody yet knows who  be was really aping for in the end, nor what hap p ened to him, do they? They don't know whether ho o s alive today."

	Menicanti made an attempt to kidnap Siria and Iris and their radio. 

	...Filing his own report to the OSS only two months later, Menicanti told his side of the tale:

		At that moment, Mr. Tompkins tried in every way to hinder my efforts to find this radio operator and his set, for reasons absolutely unknown to me. He said to everyone that I was a very doubtful person, and probably a double agent, a traitor in the service of the SS. These rumors immediately created to me all sorts of difficulties and also aroused suspicion among my agents and friends, causing me to lose a great deal of time, thus preventing me from working more efficiently. I don't believe that it is interesting to the OSS to tell you in detail all the difficulties and nuisance of Mr. Tompkins' behavior against me.

	The Allied breakout in May 1944 exposed Kesselring’s main forces to a potential trap by advancing Allied armies from Anzio and Cassino. However, in a controversial and little-understood decision, U.S. General Mark Clark (1896-1984) contravened his orders by moving northwest to capture Rome instead of cutting off the German soldiers retreating from Cassino. His decision allowed a sizable German army to escape and possibly squandered an opportunity for a quick resolution of the grinding Italian Campaign.


how did Tompkins find out about this?


Katz "Battle for Rome" says he learned it from Donovan:

	
	Sometime between the fettuccine and a postprandial digestivo, Donovan told Tompkins of the coming invasion and also disclosed that the British had agreed that all intelligence operations in Rome be conducted under the exclusive supervision of the OSS.


http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Cour-german-wehrmacht-being-stopped-shadow%E2%80%9D
	Long after the war it was revealed that Field Marshal Kesselring, upon learning of the Anzio landings, had exclaimed: “Only a miracle can save us now.” The miracle was Allied overcaution. The advantage of surprise was squandered; General Clark called off the plan to drop paratroopers, who could have prevented the movement of enemy troops against the beachhead, “lest it prematurely disclose the area of our main assault”; and Anzio settled into a stalemate as complete as Cassino. Churchill cabled Field Marshal Viscount Alexander in disgust: “I expected to see a wildcat roaring into the mountains—and what do I find? A whale wallowing on the beaches.”

	...Inevitably the Allied delay brought disillusionment and defections. On March 13 the O.S.S. learned that its security had been blown by a radio technician, “Walter”—supposedly a friend of Cervo’s—who had sold out to the Germans.


http://www.americanheritage.com/content/%E2%80%9Cour-german-wehrmacht-being-stopped-shadow%E2%80%9D
	On his way back to Washington after the Sicilian landings of July i o, 1943, General William Donovan conferred with General Mark Clark at Fifth Army headquarters in Morocco and offered to place his agency’s resources at the disposal of the Fifth Army for the coming invasion of Italy. It was decided to expand the O.S.S. functions by adding operations specialists and research experts for tactical and strategic intelligence procurement, and a special reconnaissance battalion, an O.S.S. unit reorganized on a full military basis, was assigned to the Fifth Army’s G-2, or intelligence branch. This was to be the first time that O.S.S. techniques would be employed directly by ground armies.

	...A week before Anzio, General Donovan arrived unannounced at O.S.S. headquarters in Naples, a dilapidated four-story palazzo requisitioned from an indigent Neapolitan duke. In its vast rococo rooms, radios and high explosives mingled incongruously with the duke’s gilded mirrors and heavy Victorian furniture, and the personnel feasted by candlelight on wines from their host’s cellar and fettucine made with G.I. powdered eggs. The general joined them for dinner and with instinctive courtesy insisted that Peter Tompkins, twenty-four-yearold chief of the Naples group, should preside at the head of the table. “You’re the host,” he said. “I’ll sit at your right.” Later, over coffee, he confided to Tompkins the purpose of his visit. It was expected that the coming landings at Anzio would result in an early liberation of Rome, the general explained, and he wanted someone to enter the occupied city, contact O.S.S. secret radio Vittorio , which had been operating in Rome since the previous October, and at a given signal set off sabotage and countersabotage measures to coincide with the Allied invasion. Filled with that sense of dedication that Donovan engendered in his men, Tompkins volunteered and was promptly accepted for the job. 

	...Several days passed without news of the expected Allied advance, and gradually the truth dawned on Tompkins: instead of the lightning “cat-claw thrust at the Alban Hills, General Clark’s Anglo-American forces had inexplicably decided to dig in and consolidate their defensive position on the beach against a German counterattack.

Tompkins a fan of Clark?

Katz "Battle for Rome":

	Another man taken to the Koch Gang's base along with Cervo and Mastrogiacomo, the houseboat custodian, was a police orderly named Giovanni Scottu, who had been assigned to Lieutenant Giglio that day. At war’s end, Scottu gave a sworn deposition of the torture undergone by his superior and himself as well. Detailing in precise and horrific language six distinct sessions of torture between March 17 and 23, the deposition is undoubtedly the most quoted description of torture during the occupation, particularly by the many writers who have recounted Giglio’s heroic story. Documents that have recently come to light, however, cast serious doubt on the veracity of Scottu’s testimony. 9

	9 None of those writers, including English-language authors such as Tompkins, Trevelyan, Cave Brown, and myself, took note of a 1946 challenge to Scottu’s testimony by the chief judge in Koch’s trial as a war criminal. That court, questioning whether the witness was suffering from a psychiatric illness, ordered a medical examination, which proved inconclusive. But the 2000 Griner study of Koch’s Special Police Unit uncovered sealed documents showing that Scottu, although taken into custody, was never placed under arrest. Koch himself, when interrogated, declared that Scottu physically attacked and denounced Giglio for having gotten him into trouble over something he knew nothing about, and Giglio, he said, confirmed this. In any case, Koch found Scottu to have had no role in Giglio’s OSS activities and released him. Griner’s references to the original version of Scottu’s deposition further show that all of the earlier writers had worked from an altered copy from which certain improbable erotic passages had been removed (MG: 218-220, 320-321).


look into what was going on with Scottu and his testimony


	...Still far from their quota, the list-makers waded deeper into the morass of arbitrary choices. A sense of their growing desperation can be gleaned from Priebke:

		The whole of that night we searched the records and could not find a sufficient number of persons to make up the number required for the execution. So, a further search was made of the records to see if there were any persons who had not been tried, but had been arrested for being … concerned in any outrage against German troops or had been found in possession of firearms and explosives or were leaders of “ under ground” movements. These names were added to the list. Still we could no t find sufficient persons…. 3


Priebke was involved in choosing who to execute in repreisal for Via Rasella, wrote that he was trying to find people to fill a quota


	...death-penalty-case prisoner, a perfect fit for the legitimized categories but problematical nonetheless. He was twenty-six-year-old college professor Paolo Petrucci, arrested as an anti-Fascist on the word of an informer. He had just been tried by the German tribunal and, to great surprise, had been acquitted. He was due to be released that morning. Instead, his luck ran out. Kappler, adding the young professor to the others, completed the list: 320 men—rich and poor, doctors and lawyers, workers and shopkeepers, artists and artisans, teachers and students, men and teenaged boys from every walk of life, and a man of God to walk among them. By now, something resembling a life of its own had been breathed into the reprisal machine, and Kappler, as he later said, felt its autonomous throb: “At a certain moment during the night, I said, ‘By now themselves….’” 4 


anything unusual about who they did and didn't pick?


around pg 310, says some officers refused to carry out order, ended up with band of other officers carrying out the actual killings 


pg 318, Joseph Raider says he escaped cave killings in confusion when a priest broke through his chains and blessed everyone

pg 318-320 Katz sounds like a psycopath too

pg 320 says Koch was the one to provide Giglio's name

pg 321 Nazi Lieutenant Tunnat selected 10 more to be executed who had been recently cleared of charges and released from prison, said by Katz to be at random. There names were added to Caruso's list while 10 on the list were crossed off. Footnote says nine of the men who were crossed of were spared because the prison official who replaced them thought they were chosen solely as Jews (what about 10th?)

pg 322 The Nazis had a list of 330 but killed 5 extra men. This came up at the trial were Kapler blamed Priebke. The 5 extra men became a matter of public interest later and Katz says it was the subject of a cover-up by the Nazi officers.

pg 327

	
	...But for Elena, in a certain sense, the Resistance had fallen short.

		A slaughter in reprisal had never followed any of the attacks against the Germans, but we asked ourselves how they had been able to transport such a massive number of men to the place of execution without the Resistance knowing anything about it in spite of being in a state of alert…. The Germans had rushed to murder all those hostages, hidden the bodies somehow, and left their families without a word, so that everyone would suffer the torment of not knowing whether their own loved ones were among the victims.


should look into this--it was only a few officers transporting many prisoners, and the partisans had a vast intel network, American commandos a few miles away. Should get more info on their intel network, supposedly something was declassified recently.

pg 330 Kessering claims victims were already sentenced to death, accusing pope statement blaming both sides of bias against Germans

pg 331 Malfatti told Tompkins Cervo and 12 other men from their network had been killed at Ardeatine

pg 367

	...W HEN Giuliano Vassalli, not long after the Ardeatine Caves massacre, fell into Kappler’s hands, his fellow Socialist, spymaster Franco Malfatti, took the usual precaution of dropping out of sight. He attached’himself to Peter Tompkins’s party heading for Allied territory, but the attempts at crossing the lines were leading nowhere. By the second in week in May, having tried all the points of the compass, by land and by sea, the fugitive travelers had had to retreat and were back in Rome. The situation Tompkins had hoped to resolve had taken a turn for the worse.

	The so-called skeleton organization he had left behind had been picked still cleaner by further arrests, and the effort to set up radio contact with OSS headquarters behind the lines at base appeared to be dead. Sorrentino, the bogus representative of Clark in Rome, had in the meantime reemerged but only long enough to be captured by Kappler. He would never have been sorely missed by his own side but after one night in Via Tasso, he betrayed one of Tompkins’s most trustworthy agents, the Roman Partisan Arrigo Paladini.

	Menicanti and the Allied-certified “notorious Fascist” Dr. Lima had found a new way to turn OSS operations in Rome into cash. They had begun issuing “American” documents to those who felt in need of political detoxification before facing the anti-Fascist future. For 1,000 lire, a seal of the United States would attest to the good works performed by the document holder as a freedom fighter in the anti-Nazi underground. Since the CLN, by the turnabout of Togliatti’s Communists, had wheeled to the right to accommodate Badoglio and the monarchists, many of these same born-again customers were being successfully pitched by Menicanti to add luster to their new credentials by opposing any form of insurrection when Rome changed hands. In this regard, the Rome to which Tompkins had returned was looking like the Rome Donovan had had in mind when many months back he had warned Tompkins to “just make sure they don’t rise up against each other.”

	With Tompkins a de facto castaway, the OSS in Rome had become a den of cutthroats and thieves, a travesty of what Tompkins had set out to create. The intelligence coups in the weeks following the Anzio landings had died for want of a radio. His latest and perhaps most vexing frustration was being powerless to convey the steady flow of daily German intelligence bulletins being accessed by his agent in Kesselring’s headquarters. One such bulletin had reported that six clandestine radio stations, sent behind the lines by the Fifth Army, had been infiltrated by German counterespionage and were transmitti ng false information to the Allies. A final attempt to reach OSS headquarters through the radio facilities used by a British agent Tompkins had used in the past brought news of his arrest as well.

	“The water seemed to be rising all around,” Tompkins later reported to Donovan. “Franco and I decided … [to] attempt to cross into Switzerland, as our days were definitely counted, and we had no hope of establishing contact with the base.”


Tompkins bails while things deteriorate in rome. Many of his network had been arrested, some giving up names of other collaboraters. Those worried about their fate in a future anti-Fascist Rome were able to buy forged documents saying they were faithful anti-Fasist collaboraters.

Tompkins agent in Kesselring's headquarters told him the allies were being fed misinformation by German counterintelligence in some areas, but he was unable to relay this to the allies (why?).


	That decision was altered the following day, however, when on the morning of May 12 the BBC announced the massive Allied assault on the Gustav Line. Tompkins had just received word from his man at Kesselring’s headquarters of the extent of the Germans’ surprise. They were still expecting a second attack, an amphibious landing north of Rome, and though Tompkins could only guess what the Allies were planning, this was something they had to know. The decisive spring offensive had clearly been launched; there would be precious intelligence continuously. There had to be a way to send it. He would stay in Rome to find the way.


but when the allies atacked Tompkins decided to stay in Rome and find a way to send intel


pg 372


	...Y ET the terror reigned on. On April 3, the day Socialist Partisan commander Vassalli had been arrested, Don Giuseppe Morosini, the priest who, of the two imprisoned in the Via Tasso, was not chosen by Kappler to die in the Ardeatine Caves, went before the firing squad at Fort Bravetta. It was the first execution in the ten days since the massacre, but the pace quickened, with eighteen men slated to die at the same killing ground over the next few weeks—among them Vassalli’s cousin Fabrizio Vassalli, of the Matteotti Brigades. The Socialists were to be especially hard-hit in the post-Ardeatine period, notably at the leadership level, with the arrest of the distinguished trade unionist Bruno Buozzi and the assassination of Eugenio Colorni, the head of the Party’s underground newspaper, Avanti!

	The scourge of the Roman Resistance, Kappler, had graduated from relatively innocuous police work beginnings into a stereotypical Gestapo homicidal chieftain. But he was outdone by Pietro Koch, who would rack up 435 arrests in his four months in Rome. Together, though rarely working together, they had by now all but demolished the most vigorous part of the Roman underground, despite extraordinary feats of endurance by many of their prisoners in withstanding torture.

	Kappler would always deny that he personally tortured his prisoners, and Koch would only admit to conducting interrogations patterned after what he called “the American third-degree.” 20 After the war ended it would be difficult to determine who did what to whom except in the case of Captain Erich Priebke. His years of heeling to Kappler had transported him to prominence as the subtlest and most effective grand inquisitor of the Via Tasso. His own subsequent denials might have gone further had it not been for the recent arrest of Peter Tompkins’s agent Arrigo Paladini.


the Nazis executed more, including resistance leadership, in the days following Ardeatine

Tompkin's agent Paladini was captured but survived. He gave an account of the interrogation methods of Priebke.


pg 374 The resistance, including Elena, had a plan to kill the traitor Guglielmo Blasi who was now working for Koch's group. That plan changed into a plan to kill Koch himself, but "that plan, too, ad a betrayer." Katz doesn't name the betrayer.

	...Alone and abandoned, the surviving prisoners remained locked in their cells, unfed and unaware of their reprieve. Three days earlier, on June 1, the Fascist authorities informed the Vatican that they were willing to release not only the five political prisoners in Regina Coeli for whom the Pope had intervened but everyone in their custody. They expressed a fear, however, that the Germans would object, and sought the Vatican’s help. Monsignor Montini recorded speaking to Weizsäcker about the matter but not the result. 23

	One possible result was that on June 2, which coincided with Pius XII’s name day—Sant’Eugenio on the church calendar—Partisan commander Giuliano Vassalli was summoned from his cell in the Via Tasso by Kappler. “You can thank the Holy Father,” Kappler told him, “that you’re not being sent to the wall, which is what you deserve, Vassalli, right?” Vassalli, who had been expecting execution, was unaware of the Pope’s intervention, but wasted no time inquiring further, when Father Pfeiffer suddenly appeared and Kappler turned him over to the papal emissary, saying, “Don’t ever let me see you again.” 24

	On the next day, however, six other Partisan prisoners, members of the monarchist Military Front, did go to the wall, taken from Regina Coeli to the firing squad at Fort Bravetta. That same evening of the 3rd, as the general retreat of the occupiers began, fourteen prisoners at the Via Tasso, their hands tied behind their backs, were put aboard a truck heading north. They were an odd mixture of men that included the trade-union leader Bruno Buozzi and three Italian operatives of the OSS: Tompkins’s agent Edmondo Di Pillo; Vincenzo Bonocore, the radio operator who had betrayed Cervo; and the self-appointed Fifth-Army representative, Enrico Sorrentino, who had sold out another Tompkins man, Arrigo Paladini. Paladini himself, suffering two broken ribs, was among those who boarded a second, larger truck crammed with about thirty prisoners in all. The truck carrying Buozzi and the others departed first, proceeding in the outward flow along the Via Cassia, but a few miles out of Rome it halted at the suburban hamlet of La Storta. The prisoners were made to descend behind some trees, forced to their knees, and one by one slain in the bullet-t o-neck manner used by Kappler in the massacre in the Ardeatine Caves. 25

	In the second truck, Paladini was in the company of the Gappisti turned in by Guglielmo Blasi, including Spartaco, Raoul, and Duilio, all of whom, like Paladini, were under a sentence of death by now and physically gutted. This truck, however, either by breakdown or sabotage, had failed to depart, and these men were again locked in their cells, this time unguarded, miraculously spared, a key-turn or a battering ram away from freedom. They did not have long to wait, for they were rescued within hours by an unruly crowd of Romans drunk on liberation air.


The pope intervened on behalf of 5 prisoners (why those 5?) but as the allies closed in the Fascists told the Vatican they would release everybody. Kappler released Giuliano Vassalli saying "you can thank the pope." The next day, June 3rd, the fascists executed 6 prisoners from the Military Front and 14 others, which included a trade-union leader, members of Tompkins's OSS, the radio operator who betrayed Cervo (Bonocore), and the 5th army rep who betrayed Paladini (Sorrentino). Paladini, Spartaco, Duilio, and others were to be taken in a second truck, but the truck failed to depart and they were left in their cells to be rescued.


pg 402

	
	...S OMEONE with a more substantive grievance on that day was Peter Tompkins. After nearly three months of being cut off behind the lines and boarded up nail by nail into isolation by the treachery of his rivals, Tompkins now found himself in a further predicament. He knew none of the OSS officers arriving with the Fifth Army. They were the newcomers of a restructured and restaffed organization. Many of his strongest supporters, who would later attest to the critical importance of his work in Rome, had been transferred to London for the Overlord invasion, and he was as much a stranger to the arriving agents as they were to him. Worse, the Menicanti group had managed to ingratiate itself at Tompkins’s expense, and when in the coming days the American would accuse them of sabotaging his operation and criminal activities, they would counter with charges that he was “completely mad.” 38

	Thus all his groundwork of recent weeks, identifying and setting in motion an apparatus for tracking down the Nazi spies purposely left behind in Rome, would be disregarded, and his efforts to secure living quarters, office space, and transportation for postliberation counterintelligence operations would be misinterpreted from the first day.


Katz says Tompkins was isolated in Rome by the treachery of his rivals. When the allies arrived, the OSS had already been restructured and restaffed and Tompkins knew none of their agents. Katz says his "strongest supporters" had been transfered to Overlord by then, and so his contributions were "misinterpreted." Tompkins got in a conflict with the Mnicanti group, him accusing them of sabotaging his operations and criminal activities and them calling him mad.


pg 411


	...Of all the crimes committed by the Nazis during the occupation (with one minor exception) only one was prosecuted. On the other hand, whatever the offense, the same perpetrators were complicit to them all, and justice for the victims heaped in the Ardeatine Caves would provide retribution. The steely prediction made by Carlo Trabucco that when the Romans would be free, a “pilgrimage without end” would go to the Fosse Ardeatine came to pass without delay. It


only Ardeatine and one other Nazi crime in rome was prosecuted

pg 412 a team was able to identify 322 of the bodies

pg 413 at the trial, the church backed Caruso, one of the ardeatine criminals. Romans were angry and stormed the courthouse, but Caruso hadn't shown up yet. Some of them (who?) ended up grabbing and kiling Donato Caretta instead, who was to testify against the criminals (what exactly happened here?). Caruso was tried and executed.

Pope helped Koch too? not sure what's going on here, Katz account of Koch's execution unusual

pg 416 some of the trials were done in Britain. There, Kappler testified against Mackensen and Malzer, and each blamed the other. They were sentenced to death, but their sentences were reduced. Mackenson was released in 1952. Kesselring was sentanced to death, but Churchill and General Alexander intervened and he was released in 1952. There were protests in Rome and a campaign to rehabilitate him, including Shelford Bidwell and Carlo D'Este.

pg 420 Kappler and Priebke went on trial in Rome, but Priebke had escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp--"a breakout that had apparently gone unnoticed for months." The court ruled that Via Rassalla was illegal and a reprisal was justified, but that Kappler's reprsal constituted a war crime. Kappler was sentanced to life without paroe but escaped with assistance in 1977.

pg 423 Sas and Franco calamandrei, who commanded the Va Rasella attack, were awarded for military valor

pg 423 Katz says questions of malfeasance by the Resistance were raised in Italy in 1994 (why?)

pg 424 around this time, Priebke was discovered in hiding in Argentina. He was arrested and extradited to Italy. He had escaped on the "Rat Line," an underground activity in the Vatican's refugee program.

pg 425 A military tribunal in Rome found him "guilty but not punishable" since he had obeyed a superior order. The decsion was protested in Italy and the Supreme Court annulled the verdict. They found evidence that the tribunal intended to absolve Priebke before the trial began. The court convened a new trial, and this time Karl Hass, and Ardeatine criminal who later worked for U.S. and Italian intelligence in the Cold War, was there to testify.

pg 426


	...No friend of his name-dropping codefendant, Hass was a star witness for the prosecution. In the Kappler trial, the court had concluded that the five men killed in the caves whose names were not on any list had been the result of a counting error, implicating list-keeper Priebke. Hass, however, now revealed the deep secret that had been covered up all these years: The Error of the Five Extra Men.

		At the Ardeatine [he testified], Priebke was there with the copy of the list. He got the people down [off the trucks] and canceled out their names. At a certain point, one of the prisoners was not on Priebke’s list. At the end, in fact, there were five extra men. That was when Kappler said, “What do I do with these five? They’ve seen it all.” I don’t know if it was Kappler himself, or Priebke, or who—I don’t believe it was Kappler—… I don’t know who killed these five people. 40

	There it was: a simple solution, yet plausible enough to withstand any challenge. First there was one, then two, and so on. One by one, they were shunted aside, watching the others enter the tunnels, hearing the shots, again and again, five at a time, made to wait and made to wonder all those bloodletting hours what their own fate might be. After all, when there was one, then two, the killers could not know how many extras they would end up with.


Hass testified that they didn't know how the five extra men got there.

pg 427 Hass and Priebke were sentenced  to life without parole but were released after 15 years of house arrest.

pg 428 in 1963 Pope Pius XII's efforts to save Jews from the Nazis were dramatically reevaluated and this involved the plays "Der Stellvertreter," "The Representative" and "The Deputy". There was a public debate involving some members of the clergy defending Pius XII. Some Vatican documents were made public, and some Vatican members said they were not everything and "edited according to exact scientific standards." Pope John Paul II tried to make Pius XII a saint and this was another point of controversy.

pg 429-433 Katz goes on about debate on Pius XII failing to oppose Nazis, seems to be a topic he cares about. He concludes that the Pope's conduct was a moral failure. (what was actually going on here?)

Tompkins born to wealthy family in Georgia, U.S., repeatedly stayed in Rome and visited Roman aristocracy, including prince Camilllo Caetania. In the 1920s he was close friends with Carlo Sforza, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs 1920-1921.

In 1941, he returned to the U.S. and became a correspondentt of the New York Herald Tribune before entering the OSS. He said he wanted to work for OSS to spread democracy and that he opposed monarchist Badoglio, who was backed by Churchill.


After the war he was mostly a columnist and a writer. He wrote "a spy in rome" in 1962 and "Italy Betrayed" in 1966.


	...According to Tompkins, in fact, the latter did not understand the importance of a unitary structure such as CLN , to prevent the transformation of the Resistance to the Nazi-Fascists in an internal struggle among the anti-Fascists themselves; this intuition turned out to be unfounded and will be paid by the agent after the conflict, at the time of the transformation of the OSS into the CIA, when attempts were made to deny him the recognition he deserved for his infiltrator and saboteur action. Tompkins also confirmed this opinion later in a conference in Venice, accusing the OSS of having fought on one side the Nazi regime and on the other, rescued the fascists of the Xª MAS Flotilla under the orders of Junio ​​Valerio Borghese and the commander of the SS Karl Wolff , in addition to other Nazis. Tompkins himself was convinced that there were fascist infiltrators inside the OSS;


Tompkins got in fight with OSS/CIA after war?

interesting that he accuses OSS overall of supporting Nazis and acusess Cervo of betraying names of resistance members, I guess like projecting? His failure at Rome seems pretty clear-cut, Tompkins didn't come out clean.

	
	...in one of his last public appearances on the occasion of the celebrations for the liberation of Rome (June 4, 2006 ), the American writer and agent pointed out that the mission of the OSS that commanded during the Nazi-Fascist occupation of the Eternal City would not was possible without the collaboration of Italian Resistance women and men.

Colonel Huntington appointed Minicanti cheif OSS agent in Italy. When Tompkins arrived he was appointed cheif OSS agent in Rome, and Tompkins clashed with Menincant. Another OSS agent, Enrico Sorentn, "claimed that he was appointed by General Mark Clark as cheif OSS agent in Rome."


https://books.google.com/books?id=nGLcu_QQB6cC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA23
	In Rome, Donavan had two competing and overlapping operations--Menicanti's and Tompkin's--with each man insisting that he was the head of the city's clandestine operations and no one at headquarters settling the dispute. Crockett reported that Menicanti was a "very rough, ruthless gangster type." Tompkins, he concluded, was courageous and sinccere, but the young man was in way over his head and "did a very sloppy job of security." Counterintellgence officers sifting through the Vittoria station wreckage concluded that the Germans knew about Tompkins before he even arrived in Rome and by March they had a god read on his activities in the city. The ridiculous-looking beard he grew as a disguise instead made him stand out in the capital city, they decided, and made it easier for the Gestapo to track him. "It seems quite probable," the OSS security men theorized in a later report, that the Germans let Tompkins roam freely so they could follow him and gather up the Italians he recruited as agents. By early spring, the Germans, in fact, had convinced four of the snitches they captured by following Tompkins to work for them as double agents. The most important turncoat in Tompkin's network turned out to be Franco Malfatti, the Socialist Party's military intelligence officer, who "betrayed OSS to the SD," the security officers reported.


After the war, an OSS investigation concluded that the Germans knew about Tompkins before he arrived, had a good read on his activities, and probably let him roam freely so they could track him and capture the agents he recruited. The Nazis recruited Franco Malfatti, a member of Tompkin's network and the Socialist Party's military intelligence officer.


Katz on Malfatti:

	...After a nap on a sofa, he made contact with two of the first-team agents recruited by Bourgoin: team leader Menicanti (code-named Coniglio), and Maurizio Giglio (Cervo), a Fascist police lieutenant in full uniform, working for the OSS as double agent. They were joined by two others, Elio Gambareri, associated with Badoglio and SIM, and Franco Malfatti, a member of the Socialist Party, who had fought against Franco in the Spanish civil war and had worked in the French underground in Nazi-occupied Paris.

	Although drawn to the younger men, Giglio and Malfatti—like him, both in their early twenties—Tompkins had to overcome strong misgivings to reveal to any of them that within hours there was to be an Allied landing. First, he declared that he was under the personal orders of General Donovan and, as such, was chief of the OSS in Rome. His authority unchallenged—though he would soon learn that Menicanti had been claiming himself to be the top OSS operative behind the enemy lines—Tompkins spoke in general terms of the impending invasion and the need to act quickly to coordinate their efforts with the Partisans.

	...Malfatti’s first report to Tompkins on the German response to the landing and the movement of troops to the beachhead contained vital information that, if true, could only have come from a mole well-burrowed in Kesselring’s headquarters. Moreover, it identified the precise units and their deployment in or on the way to the Anzio area, information, as it turned out, that anticipated what the Allies would discover on their own only days later.

	Tompkins’s immediate reaction was that Malfatti might be a double agent. “How the devil, I wondered, did Franco obtain information from German headquarters in Rome!” Was the American being lured into the role of an unwitting channel for disinformation?

	Malfatti apparently read his mind, offering an inscrutable smile. “You’ll just have to trust me,” he said. He could not reveal his sources but, he said, even in the German High Command there were men of non-German origins. Some of them were children of anti-Nazis, even Socialists, who had fought the rise of Hitler and his subsequent Anschluss with Austria, the conquest and absorption into the Third Reich of their once-independent country.


From Tompkin's book:

https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.461206/2015.461206.A-Spy_djvu.txt
	Later in the afternoon Franco returned with a fresh bulletin of information: 

		The situation facing the Beachhead as reported in German Headquarters in Rome is as follows: The Neltuno landings were unopposed because the Germans were taken by surprise. Thereafter the Germans did not attempt to stop the landing operations, waiting for reinforcements, and so as not to expose themselves to fire from Allied naval units. It was first thought that the objective of the landings was a march on Rome, as a result of which German Headquarters in the city were ordered to be ready to leave. It was then noted that disembarking troops were heading south; this the Germans considered fatal to the Allies as they would be trapped between the road and the marshes, an easy target for the 90th Armored Infantry Division already on the spot, and two other forthcoming Divisions (the 29th and 3rd Panzer Grenadiers) being transferred from the southern front to the Beachhead, along with units of the Hermann Goering Panzer Division al- ready heading for the Beachhead and Albanu. 

		German Headquarters in Rome have now settled down again. 

	How the devil, I wondered, did Franco obtain information from German headquarters in Rome! Should I ask him, at such an early date, to reveal the source of such high-level information? Having pressed him, would 1 be any surer of its authenticity, or would I still be just as dependent on his word? I could not, after all, go up to German headquarters and look for myself. Was he a German double agent, and I his dupe? Was I being a channel for purposely false in- formation to delude the Allies? After all Franco had admitted having had staff training with the Germans in Austria! Suddenly I saw a whole world of evidence pointing to Franco as a German agent; so much so that It made my head spin like a lover wild with jealous imagination.

	Putting down the report I looked him in the eye. 

	But be smiled back : ‘‘You’ll have to trust me. It would be dangerous 
	for me to reveal the actual source as yet — and, as you see, it is too good a source to endanger. Also, there arc psychological reasons.” 

	Then followed an explanation which 1 was bound to concede was
	valid. There were German-speaking comrades from a certain inde- 
	pendent country which Hitler had invaded and subjugated, whose 
	young men had been sent off to fight Hitler s wars. But Hitler had 
	forgotten that the fathers of such men, as Socialists, had been murdered 
	by the Nazis, and that that particular country wanted as much as any 
	other occupied land to be liberated from the Germans. It was indeed 
	an Achilles heel in the robust Teutonic armor. But the psychological 
	rub was equally evident: these men disliked betraying their military 
	comrades; in fact, would not even admit to it themselves. 

	The less said about it, I agreed, the better. 


Tompkins says he got two high-level reports from Franco on the same day, suspected he was a German agent, confronted him on his source and trusted him.

Tompkins refers to "Franco" on a first name basis throughout the book, but introduces him as "Franco Mercurio":

	The young man 
	with the aristocratic manners was Franco Mercurio; he had no OSS 
	code name but appeared to be the gatherer of intelligence for the 
	radio. The man technically in charge of the team I gathered to be the 
	one code-named “Coniglio” or rabbit, a small man with dark piercing 
	eyes more like a ferret’s than a rabbit’s. Last of the group was a man 
	called Gambareri, a jovial fellow with a paunch who looked quite inof- 
	fensive but turned out to be the front man for the Parodi-Delfino indus- 
	trial combine with a Cagoulard-typc mind. 

	Of the lot, the only one I trusted immediately was Franco, and pos- 
	sibly Cervo, the policeman, for he sided openly with Franco. 

	Despite my mi.sgivings it was time to get down to business; so I in- 
	formed them there was to be an Allied landing somewhere along the 
	coast


presumably this is Malfatti, since he was headed of the Socialist Party's intelligence. From Tompkin's book:

	
	Franco promised a more detailed report would be forthcoming in 
	the afternoon. In the meantime the best news he brought was of a 
	long and detailed discussion with the leaders of his party (principally 
	Nenni) whom he had managed to convince that one of the best ways 
	of serving the Allied cause and doing the Germans the most damage 
	would be to create a first-rate information service. For this he had been 
	granted the use of up to a hundred men to be deficcted from their 
	normal partisan activities, entirely at his orders. For obvious security 
	reasons it was not to be known they would be w'orking for an Allied 
	intelligence organization, but merely as an information service for the 
	Socialist party. 


Katz identifies him as Malfatti.

	The British were angry over what they considered a slipshod OSS operation in Italy. Even reputable Italian politicians complained to Donovan that "any scoundrel" in their country could get the ear of an OSS officer and sell him worthless information or a shady spy mission. Personnel problems had grown acute for the entire U.S. Army in Italy, with poorly trained replacements arriving from stateside, almost mutinous morale among weary front-line troops, and an alarming number of desertions or GIs shooting themselves in the foot to escape combat. Even so, the OSS operation breakdowns and security lapses in Italy had become a black eye for the agency. "Our Italian intelligence units have given me cause for anxiety," Donovan admitted in one cable to Galvin. He blamed his troubles on the Italian Americans Corvo had recruited. He thought they were mostly unreliable and addicted to political intrigue. Corvo thought Donovan and other snobby WASP's in the OSS were prejudiced against Italian Americans. But Donovan was as much at fault for the mess. The jumbled OSS organization in the country, after all, was his creation.

	By April the problems had begun to leak to the press. The New York Post speculated that FDR was unhappy "with our intelligence work in the Italian theater" and "Bill Donovan's OSS may soon by on their way out." Roosevelt was not actually paying attention to the OSS in Italy, but a senior U.S. Army officer was: General Jacob Devers, whose G-2 Donovan had threatened to throw out of a window the year before. Now the deputy supreme allied commander for the Mediterranean, Devers was convinced the OSS had wasted millions of tax dollars in Italy. He demanded "a thorough accounting" of everything Donovan had spent there. What's more, Devers intended to send his inspector general to the OSS to examine its ledgers and in the future he wanted Donovan to get his approval for every nickel the OSS spent in Italy.


The British were angry with OSS performance in Italy. Some Italian politicians said "any scoundrel" in Italy could get the ear of an OSS officer and feed them false information. Breakdowns in operations and security lapses in Italy became a black eye for OSS. Donovan was aware of this and blamed Corvo's recruits. Corvo thought Donovan and other snobby WASP's (Tompkins?) were racist against Italian Americans, which he recruited. Donovan created the OSS organization in Italy.

By April 1944 problems with the OSS in Italy had leaked to the U.S. press. FDR ignored this, but General Jacob Devers did not. He had conflicts with Donovan before. He wanted to send his inspector general to examine OSS ledgers.

NY Times on General Devers:

https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/opinion/23colley.html
	How World War II Wasn’t Won

	...Devers never crossed. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander, visited Devers’s headquarters that day and ordered him instead to stay on the Rhine’s west bank and attack enemy positions in northern Alsace. Devers was stunned. “We had a clean breakthrough,” he wrote in his diary. “By driving hard, I feel that we could have accomplished our mission.” Instead the war of attrition continued, giving the Germans a chance to counterattack three weeks later in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge, which cost 80,000 American dead and wounded.

	Garrison Davidson, then Devers’s engineering officer and later a superintendent of West Point, believed Devers’s attack would have succeeded and pre-empted the Bulge, writing, “I have often wondered what might have happened had Ike had the audacity to take a calculated risk, as General Patton would have.” Patton wrote in his diary that he also believed Eisenhower had missed a great opportunity; the Seventh Army’s commander, Lt. Gen. Alexander Patch, felt the same way.

	Why did Eisenhower refuse to allow Devers to cross? Eisenhower disliked Devers — a prim teetotaler who rubbed many gruff Army commanders the wrong way — and refused to include him among the generals fighting in northern France. Devers was appointed to lead the southern invasion by the Army chief of staff, George Marshall. Eisenhower would likely have fired Devers once the Sixth Army Group fell under his command in September 1944, but Devers had powerful patrons in Marshall and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.


according to DAVID P. COLLEY, Devers wanted to take a risk before the battle of the bulge, Eisenhower didn't like his plan and didn't like Devers, Devers had the support of George Marshall and FDR

assuming Devers one of the agentura, maybe this is what he was for? e.g. mess up the final battle with the Germans, keep WWII going on Western front and let Soviets take more.

pg 110 he goes over some of the books on OSS operations in Italy


	A slight majority of the books of this period comprised personal accounts by veterans of wartime experiencesss. The remainder was largely collections of anecdotes of OSS operations. Both types are said to have received encouragement from Gen. William Donovan, who wished some of the OSS saga told. The declassification of some records prior to the OSS's termination provided material for the collections of operational vignettes such as Ford and MacBain's Cloak and Dagger and Alsop and Braden's Sub Rosa. It is apparent that much of the literature of this era is of an embryonic quality and some, like Louis Huot's Guns for Tito, with its obvious gaps and political dyslexia, of indiifferent quality or historical value.



here is the book "guns for tito:"


http://www.znaci.net/00001/6.htm

says American and British intel supplied guns for Tito (around the same time of Foibe massacres)


https://books.google.com/books?id=P3OIFS_yzyUC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110
	Allen Dulle's The Secret Surrender is at the other end of the quality spectrum. So too is Peers and Breli's Behind the Burma Road, which, like Dulles's book, is a firsthand account of important events.

	The first of the books by former OSS members critical of some aspect of the organization appeared during this period. I term these the literature of discontent, though they were in content much more than that. Donald Downe's The Scarlet Thread and Peter Tompkins's A Spy in Rome were the initial two of this category. They differ from later studies by non-affiliated authors in that they are not attacks against the institution or intelligence activities per se; rather, they express disagreement or personal unhappiness with some policy or portion, particularly with some of the management. Tompkins fumed against the "Johny-come-latelys," official views, and the "Italo-American Mafioso" in the OSS. Downes directed his barbs at what he called the "amateurs," "cast-offs," and "stupid sons of the rich and famous" in the organization.

	...Aldo Icardi's American Master Spy is in a category of its own. The author's main motive in writing it was to give his version of the Holohan murder case in Italy

Holocan case digs up more traitors in OSS, including Icardi who supposedly did the murder. Similar to Tompkin's book? A lot of it about cervo.

	Lospinoso received his assignment -- apparently in a very sketchy way -- from Mussolini himself on March 19. It was to transfer the Jews from the coastal region to locations at least 100 kilometers from the sea. Within less than three days he arrived in Nice, set up his headquarters, and disappeared. At least he did as far as the Germans were concerned.

	On March 27, Muller, who seldom left Berlin, was received by Mussolini and asked how the mater would be handled. Mussolini promised cooperation between the two sides. When he returned to Berlin, Muller instructed Knochen to make contact with Lospinoso. On April 5, after three days of searching, Knochen (himself, not Rothke) notified Muller that he could not find him. Two days later Muller asked once again what was going on. Before resuming discusions with the Italians, after all, he had to know whether Lospinoso was even in France, as the chief of the Italian police claimed. The next day Knochen (in a letter by Rothke) wrote to Muller that Lospinoso had apparently returned to Italy. Before leaving he had left a list of questions with a captain named Francesco Malfatti di Montetretto, who was stationed in the Italian embassy in Paris. The questions had to do with German intentions against the Jews. Knochen expressed his position on the matter, or perhaps he signed a letter that expressed Rothke's opinion, which was that it seemed improper to conduct negotiations with a captain, especially given that they had been told to speak with Lospinoso. ...Knochen/Rothke added at the end of the letter that Malfatti claimed that the questions had reached him from his commanders in the army, not from Lospinoso.




https://books.google.com/books?id=nGLcu_QQB6cC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157
	The other principal agent was Franco Malfatti who established an important intelligence organization. Malfatti ad gone into exile in Austria in the thirties. He joined the Socialist Party and worked for the loyalists in the Spanish Civil War. "From then on he had been active one way or another in partisan and clandestine anti-Fascist organization." He served in the Italian army. After Mussolini's ouster he was an intelligence officer on Badoglio's staff, but at the same time in secret was working to re-organize the Socialist Party. Wen the King and Badoglio fled to Brindisi Malfatti became actively engaged in the Socialist military underground. Then he met and joined Giglio. The Socialist Party had the most effective spy system in Rome.

	It was impossible for Tompkins to operate an effective espionage network and still maintain complete political neutrality. The SIM- Badogliani intelligence had proved worthless and sometimes danger- ously misleading. The most effective spy system in Rome was directed by the Socialist Party underground, whose leaders readily agreed to channel information to Tompkins and his young Socialist assistant, Baron Franco Malfatti," 1 for transmission to the military command at Anzio. Tompkins hoped to keep this arrangement secret. He did not wish to be accused of political favoritism at a time when the CLN and Badogliani were in open conflict in the south.


Tompkins wanted to keep his relationship with the socialists secret (I guess from right-leaning parties? British? who else?)


https://books.google.com/books?id=1OAkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT289&lpg=PT289
	Malfatti's network was impressively well connected and included Italian officer and officials who had access to the highest German decision-making, doctors who talked to wounded German soldiers, and many scores of people whose homes or farms lay between Rome and Anzio and who watched German movements. Audaciously, Malfatti set up his office in the back room of a German bookshop directly across the road from the German-sequestered Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto. Here was brought information on the Germans' attack plans and the precise location of their tanks, gun emplacements and ammunition dumps. All was given to Peter Tompkins


hard to find anything about him

Katz's book "Fatal Silence" said to be a source on his network


Katz "Battle for Rome" book:

	Malfatti succeeded in a high-level infiltration of not only Kesselring’s headquarters but also Kappler’s Gestapo in the Via Tasso, the Fascist command of the Open City of Rome, the Fascist Republican secret services, the Office of Censorship, and the staffs of Rome’s luxury hotels. Thus he maintained constant surveillance and eavesdropping at the haunts of the German High Command.

	The pyramidal system provided for the rapid movement of the information gathered from local depositories to a central headquarters whose location was frequently changed. The raw intelligence, after screening and sorting, would be brought to Malfatti’s headquarters. Adding a touch of mockery of the enemy, Malfatti worked out of the offices of a German publisher and bookstore directly across from the Hotel Excelsior on the Via Veneto, the Kurfürstendamm of an exclusive Little Berlin in occupied Rome.



http://romehistorymu.wixsite.com/romehistorymu/german-occupation
	The German SS headquarters was established on Via Veneto in the Excelsior Hotel, right in the so called “dark heart of fascism”, in a very elitist part of Rome. The hotel’s main floor was transformed into a stock room for machine guns, and held, “drunken parties” while stealing anything they could and essentially sacking the hotel. Italians that were considered to be enemies to the Nazi regime of the Fascists had to fear not only the Nazi police, but Italian police as well. But while some stayed to work along with the Germans, others were more concerned of getting out of the city. A New York Times article reported that members of the new Fascist Republican militia had been slain, and fascist leaders were attempting to leave the city because “of fear of public reprisals and imminent Allied occupation.”

	Life for working-class Italians under the Nazis was harsh and terrifying. Everything they did was monitored. The Nazis set curfews that they expected to be followed. Food was scarce, and the partisans made Rome a volatile and dangerous place for the rest of the populaces, with bombs and gunfire echoing in the distance day and night.

	Several days later, Tompkins had his first serious misfortune. His radio operator was arrested by fascist police and his transmitter seized. Unable to send further intelligence, Tompkins spent the months of April and May fleeing from the fascists. These were also months of tragedy for the CLN underground. Nine Communist leaders were arrested. The Socialist resistance was also hard-pressed as two of its highest officials were taken into fascist custody. Tompkins suspected treachery. "Someone high up in the underground had been selling left- wing party members down the river." 32 


Tompkins suspects a mole

	
	...But only an OSS research unit and the Counter-intelligence Branch, X-2, maintained their base of operations in the city. When Peter Tompkins returned to Washington, his lists of suspected enemy agents were inherited by the X-2 chief, James Angleton, the son of Colonel Carter's executive officer and a thin, Yale-educated amateur poet with an amazing capacity for Byzantine intrigue. 


Tompkins gives Angleton a list


	...On September 26, Holohan, carrying $16,000 in operational funds, led his group in a parachute jump to a mountainous area some fifty miles northwest of Milan, not far from the Swiss border. They were first met by an agent of the ORI intelligence network (created a year before by Raimondo Craveri and Peter Tompkins). A meeting was then ar- ranged with Ferruccio Parri.


Tompkin's ORI (probably) murders Holohan


	...It was a depressing moment, that instant when the Cold War mentality first struck the unsuspecting intelligence amateur. Peter Tompkins, having at last recovered from his harrowing experiences in Rome, was sent to Germany to work with Socialist union groups. He found himself "with the advance guard of the OSS in Berlin, where, well inside the Soviet Zone, with a Russian major and a bottle of vodka, I realized, sadly, that our enemies had changed." 81

Katz got flak for his books ousting vatican?

https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOLLMANN,%20EUGENE_0080.pdf



https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/arts/22katz.html
	But Mr. Katz’s most frequent subject was the Holocaust, especially as it pertained to Italy. In 2003, he published “The Battle for Rome: The Germans, the Allies, the Partisans and the Pope, September 1943-June 1944,” an account of the German occupation of Rome from the fall of Mussolini to the city’s liberation. In many ways it expanded on his first book, “Death in Rome,” the one that had brought him notoriety.

	“Death in Rome” (1967) was a reconstruction of the infamous Ardeatine Caves massacre of 1944, when the Nazis, in reprisal for an attack by Italian resistance fighters on a German-speaking police battalion, herded 335 Italian men — prisoners and civilians — to a series of man-made caves on the outskirts of Rome and shot them. In his book, Mr. Katz, citing evidence he later called strong but circumstantial, said that Pope Pius XII had learned of the planned executions 19 hours before they occurred but chose to remain silent, an accusation that was immediately denied by the Vatican.

	“This is not a book of history but a polemic in which the special interests of the author are dominant and in conflict with the interests of research and presentation of the facts,” a Vatican spokesman said at the time. (Among documents later released by the Vatican, one indicated that Pius had, in fact, been made aware of the Nazi reprisal, though only five hours before it took place.)

	The book was made into a film, “Massacre in Rome,” in 1973. The next year, in a legal proceeding initiated by the niece of Pius XII, who had died in 1958, Mr. Katz along with the film’s director, George P. Cosmatos, and producer, Carlo Ponti, were charged with “defaming the memory” of Pius. They were found guilty and given suspended sentences. (Mr. Katz’s was 14 months.) After several appeals and counterappeals, the charges were set aside in 1980 by Italy’s highest court.



damn you can't say anything about the pope or you go to jail?

	In 1994 Katz was a consultant to an ABC television team which tracked down the former SS officer Erich Priebke, one of the men responsible for the Ardeatine Caves massacre, to his hideout in Argentina. The resulting interview caused outrage and led to Priebke's extradition to Italy and subsequent sentencing to life imprisonment. In 1997 Katz published an account of the trial, Dossier Priebke.

D'Este was one of the guys who tried to cover for a Nazi--what's up with that?


article on "Battle for Rome" by Katz:

https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/books/chapters/the-battle-for-rome.html
	Notified at his headquarters in East Prussia within minutes of the attack, Hitler shrieked for revenge, demanding a reprisal that would "make the world tremble." His bile alone set in motion a hastily assembled killing machine in Rome that would overcome even internal opposition from the occupiers themselves. The next day, 335 men and teenaged boys - a near-perfect cross section of the male half of Rome, not one of them even remotely connected to the attack - were seized from various parts of the city, trucked to an abandoned labyrinth of caves in Via Ardeatina, near the Christian catacombs of ancient Rome, and slain in groups of five. It was the first wartime atrocity and one of the worst perpetrated on Italian soil.

	...The dramatic story of Rome under the German occupation (September 8, 1943-June 4, 1944) remains largely untold, particularly outside of Italy. No English-language work on the subject has appeared in the last twenty years, leaving untapped a wealth of significant primary material that has since become available. Between 2000 and 2002 the CIA released the so-called crown jewels of America's wartime intelligence - hundreds of thousands of long-classified documents of its predecessor agency, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The declassified diplomatic papers of the Vatican archives relating specifically to the occupation of Rome have barely been skimmed, likewise those of the Italian archives; similarly underreported - and entirely unpublished - is the mass of material generated in the mid-90s by the two Rome trials of former SS officer Erich Priebke, as well as documents from trials in the late 70s and 80s, including my own. Thus, earlier books about the occupation did not have the benefit of the now nearly complete and nuanced big picture.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/06/27/allies-knew-of-plan-for-italys-jews/94bf1e8f-23f8-4da2-bd00-460668d3b82f/?utm_term=.48489026a4b9
	The message from Nazi security headquarters, as deciphered by Allied code-breakers, was blunt and chilling. Despite the reservations of some German officials in Rome, Nazi leaders were determined to push ahead with "the immediate and thorough eradication of Jews in Italy."

	Released yesterday at the National Archives as part of a massive effort to declassify World War II war crimes records, the decrypted Nazi message of October 1943 shows for the first time that the Allies had extensive and almost contemporaneous intelligence on the Nazi roundup of Italian Jews, thanks to Britain's Enigma code-breaking operation. It provided new evidence in a long-running debate on what the Allies knew about the Holocaust at the time and whether anything could have been done to prevent the murders of millions of Jews.

	The intercepted intelligence messages were circulated to a small group of British officials, including Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and also were swiftly relayed to the U.S. government. Although Churchill was an avid consumer of raw Enigma intelligence, it is not known whether he or anyone of authority in Washington read these particular reports.

	Historians described the release of 400,000 pages of material--from the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency--as a major step for understanding the secret war between the Allies and Nazi Germany. The documents include some of the most closely guarded secrets of the war, dealing with OSS sources and methods, the so-called "crown jewels" of the American wartime intelligence operation.


well they were asking Malfatti about it


	...Some historians believe the notion that Allied leaders were largely ignorant of the Holocaust will now have to be revised. Others go even further and argue that Churchill and Roosevelt had a moral obligation to issue much more explicit public denunciations of Nazi behavior based on the intelligence intercepts.

	"A statement by Churchill or Roosevelt might have led the Jews of Rome to take seriously the evidence of imminent deportation," said Timothy Naftali, an intelligence expert at the University of Virginia, one of two American academics appointed by the National Archives to review the latest materials.


Damn Churchil and Roosevelt helped cover up the Holoaust too

maybe it's because they're fucking Nazis

writeup on the documents


    October 15	

    Heinrich Mueller, head of the Gestapo, talks with a German Foreign Office official about the difficulties of seizing Jews in foreign countries with limited police manpower. He indicates misgivings about Hitler's order to roundup the Jews of Rome.

    *October 16	

    Kappler reports to Kaltenbrunner that German forces managed to seize 1,259 Jews in Rome. The Italian police were considered unreliable in this action, and the Italian public engaged in passive resistance. Although the German police had to release the part-Jews, foreign Jews, and families in mixed marriages, they are scheduled to ship off 1002 Jews on October 18.


is this when Mueller was talking to Malfatti?
