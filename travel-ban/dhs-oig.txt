	After about 90 minutes, Ali finally emerged from the terminal and instantly fell into an embrace with her sister, mother and brother-in-law.

	"Never in a million years did I imagine something like this would happen," said Ali, a software developer. "This is home for me."

	Ali said part of her trip to Sudan was to obtain a Sudanese passport as part of the process to gain her U.S. citizenship.

http://thehill.com/latino/317249-trump-admin-picks-new-border-patrol-head
	The Trump administration on Tuesday got its new Border Patrol chief, according to an announcement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

	Acting Commissioner Kevin McAleenan named Ron Vitiello as his replacement in a post on the agency’s Twitter account on Tuesday.


Trump admin rotating border patrol cheifs


Kevin there for exactly the few days of shit hitting fan for travel ban


this is the guy Kelly kept directing questions too like "he would know"


https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/31/transcript-media-availability-executive-order-secretry-kelly-and-dhs-leadership

Kevin says everything is fine


points out "thousnads" of LPRs were let in, doesn't mention the ones that were detained (or that his was the text of the EO)


what is Kevin's purpose? to take the fall and then dissappear? maybe can have an excuse like "I was ramping up to job"


https://fcw.com/articles/2017/01/31/kelly-dhs-vetting-rockwell.aspx
	"I think it's fair to acknowledge that communications publicly and interagency haven't been the best in the initial rollout of this process," McAleenan said.


but Kevin does admit some things weren't the best

DHS OIG looked at travel ban rollout, but some weird things happened and OIG head resigned:



http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/30/politics/dhs-inspector-general-travel-ban/index.html
	Washington (CNN)The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general is retiring from his post as a battle continues over whether the department will allow the release of a report he wrote critical of the administration's travel ban.

	DHS watchdog John Roth will be stepping down, his office confirmed, though spokeswoman Arlen Morales said the decision has been in the works for some time and is not related to the fight over the travel ban report. 


	...Roth told the senators in his earlier letter that his report had found that the leadership of Customs and Border Protection within DHS had "virtually no warning" for the travel ban, which places varying restrictions on travel to the US by nationals from certain countries -- many of them with Muslim majorities -- and has been the subject of litigation since its controversial release in January and subsequent rewrites.

	The inspector general said that while Customs and Border Protection overall made a good-faith effort to implement the ban and follow court instructions, it did violate court orders in preventing travelers abroad from boarding airplanes to the US. And while he was able to find that some accusations of misconduct in the US did not occur, Roth said the office "cannot rule out that isolated abuse occurred."

	Regarding DHS's assertion of privilege, Roth wrote that he was "very troubled" by the department's efforts to stop the report's release. He said it was the first time in his tenure that such an event had occurred. 



I thought the rollout was "perfect"


	...Depending on DHS's next steps, Duckworth is considering writing to inspectors general government-wide on whether they have faced a deliberative process issue before and, if the report continues to be unreleased, whether there are legislative options to strengthen the Inspector General Act, according to her office. 


might have to change law just to allow IGs to do their job



https://www.oig.dhs.gov/file/4709/download?token=2Agt2rpj
	Additionally, Department leadership has indicated that they are alsoreviewing the document for material covered by the “deliberative processprivilege,” and have yet to decide whether they will invoke that privilege,which would prevent us from releasing to you significant portions of thereport. I am very troubled by this development.

	The deliberative process privilege is a common law privilege, largely invoked in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and civil litigation, which permits (but does not require) the government from disclosing predecisional and deliberative communications because of the potential chilling effect such disclosure would have on the candid deliberations and back-and-forth discussion that effective policy-making requires. However, invoking the privilege can mask discovery of decisions made based on illegitimate considerations, or evidence of outright misconduct.


this is very troubling


because it looks like Trump deliberated to fuck up everything else just so he could fire his AG


	For that reason, in civil litigation the privilege is not absolute but requires a court to balance the competing interests of the parties. This has been interpreted to mean that a party requesting the information may overcome the privilege by showing a “sufficient need for the material in the context of the facts or the nature of the case . . . or by making a prima facie showing of misconduct.” Redland Soccer Club Inc., v. Dep’t of Army of U.S., 55 F.3d 827, 854 (3d Cir. 1995). Unlike civil litigants, however, we are not able to have a federal court or other disinterested party decide these issues, but must rely on the good faith of the Department.


no kidding!



found CBP (part of DHS) caught by surprise, didn't know basic things about the EO like if applied to LPRs or not


there was one CBP officer doing something unusual/wrong under investigation (don't think is trivial). But otherwise found officers trying to help stranded people, use their own funds to by them water. Basically saying most behaved like human beings. But, "cannot rule out isolated abuse occured."


most under EO got waivers, didn't find any terrorists


Found CBP confused about court orders, "did not recieve immediate guirdance" (why?), some found out by TV, some went extra mile and flagged down taxiing aircraft to let someone return.


CBP didn't tell detained LPRs they could get lawyers


CBP "very agrressive" and violated court orders for planes bound to U.S. POEs

violated Boston court order, issued "no board" instruction to airlines (who did this? remember lawyer saying it was "the airlines" who were blocking people)

issued "no board" to airlines in violation of multiple court orders



https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dhs-watchdog-review-travel-restriction-rollout-n716111
	Kevin McAleenan, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, said Tuesday that in some cases, airlines "overinterpreted our guidance" on which visa holders should be stopped from boarding U.S.-bound flights. 


but it wasn't Kevin's fault

	Despite the lack of permission to release the report, Roth's seven-page letter does outline its key findings. He suggests that while most Customs and Border Protection staffers did their best to implement the policy humanely, the lack of advance notice caused significant problems and led to a lack of clarity on key issues, including whether so-called green card holders were covered by the ban.

	"During the early period of the implementation of the order, neither CBP nor the Department was sure of the answers to basic questions as to the scope of the order, such as whether the order applied to Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), a significant percentage of the affected travelers and a fundamental question that should have been resolved early in the process," Roth wrote.

	The IG review compliments CBP personnel at various ports, saying many used their own funds to buy food and water for travelers delayed by the policy. The report also finds that officers generally complied with court orders that were quickly issued freezing efforts to expel travelers from the U.S.

	However, Roth said CBP defied court orders by providing guidance to airlines not to allow travelers from certain countries to board flights bound for the U.S.

	"While CBP complied with court orders at U.S. ports of entry with travelers who had already arrived, CBP was very aggressive in preventing affected travelers from boarding aircraft bound for the United States, and took actions that, in our view, violated, two separate court orders," he wrote.


summarizes: CBP officers act humanely, got unclear direction, CBP HQ orders airlines to ignore court order

	
	Records obtained by POLITICO through an ongoing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit underscore concerns by DHS personnel that there was no clear guidance about how to interpret the first order.

	"We got a memo from the White House saying one thing and now the Press Secretary said another," a senior CBP official wrote to an American Airlines executive in a Feb. 1 email explaining why the agency just abruptly withdrew guidance sent to major international air carriers.


politico FOIA also found conflicting directions, unclear guidance, confusion
