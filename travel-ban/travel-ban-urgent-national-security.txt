	Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!

	If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the "bad" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad "dudes" out there!

	Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!

	Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!

	Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision

	Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!

	We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.

	When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!


does he see it less as a matter of national security and more of proving he's right, proving he can do it, constitution be dammed?

In court, Trump admin argued it was an urgent matter of national security for the emergency stay. Trump sometimes undermines that argument in his public statements, like "we will give them visas after 90 days"... how does that even make sense?

Feb 4 on twitter Trump upset about travel ban decision by courts, blame court for harming national security, nag lawyers about "not using Boston decision" (??)

feb 7

around 8:15, Trump demonstrates he understands that the legal battle is (according to his logic) letting "bad dudes pour in"

	"...It may take a little while. And you know, this is a very dangerous period of time because while everybody is talking and dealing, a lot of bad people are thinking about, hey, let's go in right now. But we're being very, very tough with the vetting -- tougher than ever before...."


says that because the ban was blocked, this is a "very dangerous period of time"

actually not sure what these dates mean

	Feb 5 [Sunday]

	...The Republican president labeled Robart a “so-called judge” on Saturday, a day after the Seattle jurist issued a temporary restraining order that prevented enforcement of a 90-day ban on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a 120-day bar on all refugees. 

	A U.S. appeals court later on Saturday denied the government’s request for an immediate stay of the ruling.

	...In his ruling on Friday, Robart questioned the use of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States as a justification for the ban, saying no attacks had been carried out on U.S. soil by individuals from the seven affected countries since then. 


so the ruling was on the third, and that's what the above court doc summarizes I guess?

docs on that case

This is " Reply in Support of Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal [Ct. of App. ECF# 70] " date Feb 3


argument against an injuction by Washington state. Saying they wanted an emergency stay against the injunction

tries to argue EO does not apply to LPRs

where do they argue it's an "emergency"?
