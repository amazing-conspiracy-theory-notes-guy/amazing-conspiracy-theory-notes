	hen, late in the day on January 29, 2017, Defendant DHS Secretary
John Kelly issued a press release suggesting that the Executive Order would not be
applied to lawful permanent residents “absent the receipt of significant derogatory
information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare.” That press
release is not a formal statement of agency policy can be revoked at any time by
the Secretary in his discretion, and it is unclear whether Defendants’ guidance to
their employees matches that statement.


	...On information and belief, Defendants have also spoken publicly
about the Order to international airlines, which has resulted in the prevention of
numerous legal permanent residents from boarding flights bound for the United
States, including flights bound for Atlanta Hartsfield/Jackson International Airport.



guys filing this know what was going on in CBP?





detained at discretion of CBP

had to wait for "an email" to enter U.S.

had to wait for senior CPB to clear him and it was entirely up to them


so argued they had discretion to bar his entry whenever he wanted and was uncertain if he could leave and come back to U.S. for work

why does his experience coming back matter? I guess if facts from that lead one to infer that his admission up to their discretion, he has reason to be unsure if he can continue his work and so can sue asking for clarity (which was in prayer for relif iirc)


does special assignments in middle east and regularly travels there for work


when he came back detained, CBP officer told him he could be denied entry under EO

said they needed to seek "an email" to see if he would be allowed to enter U.S. (from who?)

wasn't given any explanation


says EO substitutes case-by-case discretionary exemption with no mechanism for appeal for due process provided by Congress
