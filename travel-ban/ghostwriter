    ...COOPER: Do you agree there was no legal issue with Flynn's underlying behavior?

    YATES: I don't know how the White House reached the conclusion that there was no legal issue. It certainly wasn't from my discussion with them.

    ...COOPER: If you hadn't been fired, if you are still in your position and you hadn't seen action over the course of that 18 days, was there more your role as the acting attorney general would have permitted you to do?

    YATES: I would have gone back to the White House.

    COOPER: If you were still the acting attorney general, you would have gone back to the White House.

    YATES: I have been knocking on the door then, yes.

    COOPER: Why?

    YATES: Because I would have been concerned that we had a national security advisor who was compromised. I wouldn't be able to control what happened, but I would have gone back to White House.

	“At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful,” Yates wrote. She wrote that “for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.”

	Yates’s view is perhaps unsurprising; she was second-in-command at the Justice Department under President Obama, held over until a new attorney general can be confirmed. Still, her announcement is remarkable for its defiance.

	Document Message from Sally Yates to Justice Department lawyers before she was fired

	...[OLC]'s review does not take account of statements made by an administration or its surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order's purpose. And importantly, it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just.

	...Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.

	First lawsuit in Chicago challenges Trump travel ban

	Posted January 30, 2017 by admin

	A Chicago man who traveled to his native Iran to care for his ailing mother is asking a federal judge to declare President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration unconstitutional.

	...The plaintiff is an Iranian citizen and legal permanent resident of the U.S. who lives in Chicago with his wife and three children, according to the lawsuit. Earlier this month, he traveled to Iran to care for his ailing mother, who was alone there after his father died, the suit said.

	The man was planning to return to Chicago in early February in time for the birth of his first grandchild, according to the suit. But when he tried to purchase a ticket for his return flight on Saturday, the ticketing agency “refused to issue a ticket for his travel to the United States due to the executive order,” the suit said.

	LA Judge Issues Most Sweeping Order Yet Against Trump Immigration Ban

	...In the Los Angeles lawsuit, the Yemeni families argued Trump’s order violates their right to due process, unlawfully targets Muslims based on their religion in violation of the First Amendment, among other constitutional arguments.

	The plaintiffs had left war-torn Yemen and obtained their U.S. immigration visas in the nearby country of Djibouti, Africa, after completing the U.S.’s vetting process and before Trump issued his executive order, but were blocked from leaving Africa.

	YATES: Two meetings and then a phone call at the end to let him know...

	WHITEHOUSE: That the material was available if he wanted to see it.

	YATES: ... that the material was available. He had to call me back. He was not available then and I did not hear back from him until that afternoon of Monday the 30th.

	WHITEHOUSE: And that was the end of this episode, nobody came over to look at the material?

	YATES: I don't know what happened after that because that was my last day with DOJ.

	The Yates firing is certainly a splashy story — stirring up all kinds of righteous indignation on the American left. But questions have arisen about just how appropriate her defiance was...
