seems like almost anyone negatively affected could have got a TRO against the EO?

all you have to do is demonstrate harm, argue can continue

other than that need strong likeliness to win, being Muslim ban probably enough


was a TRO ever not granted? (besides reasons like Wash v. Trump TRO already there)
