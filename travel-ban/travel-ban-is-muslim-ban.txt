	Secondly I'm estbalishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don't want them here. We want to ensure we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love, deeply, our people. We will never forget the lessons of 9/11 nor the heoroes who lost their lives at the Pentagon. They were the best of us. We will honor them not only with our words, but with our actions, and that's what we're doing today.
