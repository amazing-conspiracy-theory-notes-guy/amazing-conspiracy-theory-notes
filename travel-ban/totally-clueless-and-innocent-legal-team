	Reports from NBC and other outlets say that Donald Trump’s Friday executive order on immigration wasn’t vetted by his legal experts. At least, not the ones that presidents usually rely on.


    Trump WH shielded ban order from “formal review by NSC lawyers, or by any agency, including DoD”

    several sources tell @KenDilanianNBC

    — Ari Melber (@AriMelber) January 29, 2017

    senior DHS official tells @NBCNews that career professionals at State/DHS had no input on directives. now scrambling to interpret/implement

    — John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) January 28, 2017

    senior Justice official tells @NBCNews that Dept had no input. not sure who in WH is writing/reviewing. standard NSC process not functioning

    — John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) January 28, 2017

And here’s one more note from a Politico reporter.

    Minor example of weak vetting of Trump EOs: anti-terror one cites wrong provision of fed immigration law 8 USC 1222. Means 1202. Whatev!

    Gene Hamilton, a senior counselor to the Homeland Security secretary since January and top immigration policy expert for the administration, confirmed the move to CNN.

    Hamilton's departure will be a blow to Homeland Security's policy shop, sources familiar with the situation said. The agency is tasked with managing the vast majority of the administration's immigration portfolio.

    ...Justice also is charged with representing the government in litigation -- which would include all the sanctuary cities litigation, DACA lawsuits and ongoing travel ban litigation.


this guy involved in developing EO?


https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-official-behind-the-end-of-daca-explains-himself
    Last week, I obtained a two-hundred-and-thirty-five-page transcript of a deposition that Hamilton was compelled to give, in late October, as part of a federal lawsuit over the Administration’s handling of DACA, the Obama-era program that protected from deportation some eight hundred thousand undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the U.S. as children. The lawsuit was brought by Make the Road New York, the National Immigration Law Center, and the Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic at Yale Law School. The groups’ argument is that, while the government may have been within its power to cancel DACA, the manner in which it did so—suddenly, and without warning—violated the rights of the people who relied on DACA for work permits, student loans, and other benefits. During the proceeding, Hamilton was pushed to describe the part he’d played in various Administration decisions. Over four hours, he detailed his interactions with senior officials such as Kelly and Miller, shared his personal views on immigration policy, and acknowledged, notably, that he’d been the author of the September 5th D.H.S. memo that formally terminated DACA. And, while Hamilton was careful not to answer more than he had to, the transcript offers a rare glimpse of an Administration official candidly discussing the development of a major area of policy.

    ...In Sessions’s office, Hamilton met Stephen Miller, who was Sessions’s communications director at the time. In August, 2016, after Sessions had endorsed Donald Trump for President and Miller had begun writing speeches for the candidate, Hamilton volunteered to work for Trump’s transition team. When Trump won last November, Hamilton’s responsibilities increased. “I was generally the lead on development of all immigration-policy issues for the transition entity, and so everyone who worked on that reported to me,” he said. He oversaw a team of roughly a dozen people, and one of his jobs was to recommend appointees for agencies including D.H.S., ICE, and the Justice Department.


sounds like it


http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/17/politics/jeff-sessions-team-takes-over-washington/index.html
    Already, a network of former Sessions staffers and like-minded allies have made an impact on the administration. When Trump rolled out his controversial travel ban, it caught Congress and many of the agencies that would implement it by surprise. The administration maintains that it worked with the Department of Homeland Security on the order. But according to sources familiar, the coordination largely amounted to two former Sessions staffers -- Stephen Miller in the White House and Gene Hamilton at DHS -- working together mostly without the knowledge of other rank and file and leadership at DHS.


CNN says it was largely Miller and Hamilton working on EO

    ...Other members of the Sessions coalition that are now in key administration posts include Julie Kirchner, a former executive director of FAIR who is now working in a top role at Customs and Border Protection; Kathy Nuebel-Kovarik, a former staffer for Grassley now directing policy at US Citizenship and Immigration Services; and Dimple Shah, a former House Judiciary Committee staffer under Goodlatte, most recently of House Oversight, now working on immigration policy at DHS.


also worked on EO? 

    ...Hill sources readily leaked stories about how members of Goodlatte's current staff on Judiciary helped write the controversial travel ban executive order through their work on the transition, the details of which were unknown to Goodlatte himself, which drew concern on the Hill as even Republicans criticized the lack of consultation in advance from the Trump White House. 


apparently some former Goodlatte staffers worked on it

CNN says Miller and Bannon overruled DHS interpretation of LPRs, although emails make it look like that was Hamliton

Hamilton is the guy who sent EO to CBP apparently, email "final signed"

Kevin asked him about the LPR thing and he is one who said "should generally be given the case-by-case exemption provided it is in the national interest"


In initial disucssion of EO Joe Maher also on there too, what he says is redacted


pg 70

On Jan 29 at 1:33 AM Kevin is still apparently asking about language of EO, or "Language of the instruction"

or wanted them to review some instruction he was giving out

sent to Joseph Maher, Nader Baroukh, and Gene Hamilton

maybe these are go-to people on how EO supposed to work? Kevin asked Hamilton on "intent" of EO

subject of jan 29 email is "PLEASE REVIEW: Language of the instruction", but the whole email is redacted.

pg 72

at 1:39 AM that night Kevin sends out on email "IMMEDIATE ACTION: Executive Order Implementation and compliance with EDNY Court Order"

says to consider detainees for a waiver and not deport them--what else can you do if they can't be deported, detain them forever? for 90 days? (actually legal).

maybe this is what he ran by Maher, Baroukh and Hamilton

I guess this was their pivot/"adapting" to the court order mentioned in Kelly/Kevin press conference

pg 155

Randolph D Alles tells Kevin that "Gene" is discussing Mohammad v. Trump (looks like the one with TRO on EO) with "S1." Kevin asks "how does it sound?"  Alles says "S1 said comply with order and [REDACTED]."

midnight that nigh pg 160 Kevin writes "please see guidance from consel" below on impelementing Mohammad v. Trump

pg 162 email sent at feb 2 2:38 AM

apparently hamilton or "S1" and "counsel" interpreted the order as only applying to LAX

    Most, though, are trying to move past the immigrant label and offer a businesslike mantra of better schools, roads and services to all constituents. One is Nader Baroukh, 39, the part-time Falls Church mayor. A federal government lawyer, he comes from an insular and private group: Jewish exiles from Iran.


same guy? I guess a fed immigration lawyer and also mayor of falls church, and WaPo writes about him

nothing on google about him working on EO

just was for whatever reason a point of contact for questions about the EO for CPB

"Do it Right the First time"

http://www.asylumist.com/2017/07/19/were-all-in-atlanta-now/
    Gene Hamilton – Counsel to DHS Secretary: Gene Hamilton was appointed as counsel to DHS Secretary John Kelly. Along with Stephen Miller, he was apparently a key architect of the Trump Administration’s travel ban against people from several majority-Muslim countries. He also served as a trial attorney at the Atlanta OCC in about 2014 and 2015, though I could not verify his length of service there. In addition, Mr. Hamilton served on the staff of Senator  Jefferson Beauregard Sessions before he was appointed Attorney General. Mr. Sessions, of course, is well known for his regressive views on immigration, civil rights, and just about everything else.

    So there you have it. Three veterans of the Atlanta OCC who together will be exercising significant control over our country’s immigration system. Given their backgrounds and experience (or lack thereof), it’s difficult to be optimistic about how that system will fare under their watch.


Jason Dzubow says Hamilton "apparently key architcecht" of travel ban. Was also trial attorney in Atlanta. Dzubow implies Hamilton wrote the EO because he is inexperienced and worked for Sen Jeff Sessions, who is racist.


Dzubow is an immigration lawyer who writes op-eds sometimes (https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-h-1b-visas-be-easier-to-get/unfilled-positions-reduce-productivity)

    When he graduated from law school, in 2010, he was accepted into an honors program at D.H.S., and he eventually landed back at ICE, as a lawyer in the Office of Chief Counsel in Georgia. In February, 2015, he left ICE to work as the general counsel to Jeff Sessions, who was then the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on immigration. “I had a tremendous working relationship with then Senator Sessions, and we spoke on a nearly daily basis, if not multiple times a day,” Hamilton said during the deposition. In Sessions’s office, Hamilton met Stephen Miller, who was Sessions’s communications director at the time. In August, 2016, after Sessions had endorsed Donald Trump for President and Miller had begun writing speeches for the candidate, Hamilton volunteered to work for Trump’s transition team.

sounds like Hamilton knows his shit

worked for sessions Feb 2015 to August 2016, then started working for transition team


    Throughout the deposition, Hamilton declined to discuss many aspects of his work at D.H.S., citing privilege. He also said that he had signed a nondisclosure agreement to cover his time on the Trump transition team. As a result, his testimony often became choppy, a crosstalk of interruptions from Hamilton’s lawyers on one side and rephrased and reiterated questions from Karen Tumlin, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center who was conducting the deposition, on the other. At times, there was extensive back and forth just to elicit a yes or no answer from Hamilton.


signed an NDA for work on Trump transition team

9        A.  Yes.
10        Q.  Who else was at that meeting?
11        A.  As I recall, the acting secretary, the Chief
12   of Staff.  I believe the Deputy Chief of Staff as
13   well.  Gene Hamilton.  Joe Maher.  Nader Baroukh,
14   Dimple Shah, myself, of course.  I believe Kathy
15   Nuebel, Craig Symons, I believe our chief of counsel.
16   I think as well Tom Homan.  I'm trying to look around
17   the room.  I think one of his advisors was there, if I
18   recall correctly, John Feere.  I might be
19   mispronouncing the last name.  I think Kevin McAleenan
20   was there from customs and border protection.  But
21   certainly, it was someone from his team, or two
22   people, I think, from his team.  And, I believe, Kevin
23   was there.  If not, it would have been Ron Vitiello.
24   I'm not remembering exactly.

    Section 101(a)(13)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(13)(A)) is amended by adding at the end the following: “An alien’s adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident status under any provision of this Act, or under any other provision of law, shall be considered an ‘admission’ for any purpose under this Act, even if the adjustment of status occurred while the alien was present in the United States.”.

    ...Kris Kobach – the Secretary of State of Kansas served as a policy adviser on immigration


------

http://kcur.org/post/kobach-counseling-trump-travel-ban-still-discussing-administration-post

    Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach told Republicans gathered Saturday in Manhattan for their 2017 state convention that he was advising President Donald Trump and members of his national security team on a travel ban.

Kobach advised Trump on litigation strategy for travel ban


    ...On the travel ban, Kobach said Trump is considering several options. They include issuing a revised executive order that instead of blocking travel from select counties would suspend the nation’s refugee program “in its entirety” for three months.

    The hiatus would give officials time to assess and strengthen the vetting process, Kobach said, ticking through a list of terrorists who he said had used the refugee program to enter the country over the last 20 years.

    “That’s critically important, because if you are a terrorist attempting to enter the United States that’s the best mechanism you can use,” Kobach said. “You can come in illegally, claim asylum once you get here and then have that green card that allows you to go back and forth.”


https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/politico50/kris-kobach/
    As a Harvard undergraduate, he studied under Samuel Huntington, known for his prediction of a coming “clash of civilizations” between Islam and the West.


lovely


    When Kobach joined the Justice Department right before the 9/11 attacks, he helped craft a program to fingerprint and monitor entrants from 25 mostly Muslim-majority countries, a kind of precursor to Trump’s travel ban. And in 2006, Kobach began working on a number of anti-immigration efforts in Arizona, culminating in the state’s controversial “show-me-your-papers” law, which required police officers to request the documentation of people they suspected of being in the country illegally.

    After President Trump’s initial immigration ban executive order was plagued by a series of legal challenges, the Trump Administration unveiled a revised version it hopes will avoid any legal hurdles.  Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach discussed the new version of the executive action.

    “I think this new order is going to be a lot harder for opponents of it to defeat in court,” Kobach told the FOX Business Network’s Neil Cavuto.
