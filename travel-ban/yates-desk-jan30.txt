	Update, Jan. 30, 2017, at 2:15 p.m.: Rep. Jim Costa, a Democrat who represents California’s 16th congressional district, released the following statement about the Ali family:

    	Due to President Trump’s hasty decision making, a 12-year-old girl with parents who are U.S. citizens and Los Banos residents is banned from entering the United States. My office is doing everything within our jurisdiction to help Mr. Ali and his daughter to get home as soon as possible and safely.

    	As a member of Congress, my number one priority is Americans’ safety both at home and abroad, and I think it’s obvious that keeping a 12-year-old out of the country is not strengthening the safety of our nation.

	PENCE: I think the early days of this administration are going to be described in the history books as days of action.

	And the American people welcome the decisiveness that President Trump has shown on this issue, putting the safety and secretary of the American people above the niceties of communicating with people in Washington or in some cases around the world. He acted.
