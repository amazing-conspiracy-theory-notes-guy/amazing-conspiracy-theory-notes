	On Friday night, the federal government sent guidance to airlines, telling them that nationals of seven majority-Muslim countries would no longer be allowed into the US — and that, therefore, they shouldn’t be allowed on US-bound planes, either.

	And airlines (despite some confusion) complied. They had to. Under federal law, it’s illegal for an airline to allow anyone to board a US-bound flight who doesn’t have a valid passport or visa. Airlines that don’t properly screen their passengers are subject to a $3,000 fine for each person they improperly bring to the US in addition to other penalties

what did airlines say about allowing green cards?

according to twitter of Daniel Dale on Jan 28, Air Canada said green card holders could not board

	“We are required to ensure passengers have the required documents for entry into, or transit the countries they are travelling to,” said spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur. “In the case of these nationalities, they are not permitted to enter the U.S.”


I think another arline (qatar based) said they could

	U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has briefed the global trade group that passport-holders from states such as Iran and Iraq, including cabin crew, will be barred entry to the United States, IATA said in an email to its member airlines, seen by Reuters. The email underscores airlines' confusion about the situation as well as the challenge some may face from crew scheduling.

	...IATA was informed that lawful permanent residents of the United States - or green-card holders - from those countries are not included in the ban. However, a Trump administration official told reporters that green-card holders from the countries need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return, causing some confusion for airlines, which still plan to follow CBP guidance. Qatar Airways said earlier on its website Saturday that passengers would need a green card or diplomatic visa to enter the United States.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-30/airlines-scramble-to-adjust-to-trump-s-new-world
	The International Association of Air Transport (IATA) said the executive order “placed additional burdens on airlines to comply with unclear requirements” and imposed implementation costs and penalties. IATA is seeking “clarity” from the U.S. administration. “Moreover, we urge all governments to provide sufficient advance coordination of changes in entry requirements so that travelers can clearly understand them and airlines can efficiently implement them,” the Geneva-based group said in a statement.


http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2017-01-30-01.aspx
	Statement on the US Executive Order on Travel 

	...These systems can only support the efficient implementation of any government’s directives by the global air transport industry with advance coordination as well as with detailed and consistent operational information.

	Entry requirements for the United States were changed significantly and immediately by an Executive Order (EO) issued 27 January 2017. The EO was issued without prior coordination or warning, causing confusion among both airlines and travelers. It also placed additional burdens on airlines to comply with unclear requirements, to bear implementation costs and to face potential penalties for non-compliance.

	We ask for early clarity from the US administration on the current situation. Moreover, we urge all governments to provide sufficient advance coordination of changes in entry requirements so that travelers can clearly understand them and airlines can efficiently implement them.​


IATA says airlines were confused by order, had trouble complying

	5:15 p.m.

	Qatar Airways is advising passengers bound for the United States from seven newly banned majority Muslim countries that they need to have either a U.S. green card or diplomatic visa to travel.

	A statement on the company’s website says: “Nationals of the following countries: Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen ... may travel to the U.S. only if they are in possession of a permanent resident card (Green card) or any of the below visas.”


airlines confused, some allowing LPRs but some not?

airlines had to change crew to comply with ban


http://airlines.iata.org/news/legal-symposium-2017-aviation-in-the-trump-administration
	Two major talking points were the Executive Order (EO) that changed entry requirements to the United States without prior warning and the future of air traffic control. 

	The EO caused considerable confusion. Passengers that had boarded planes legally found they were illegal on arrival.

	However, while the public debate focused on the human element, the EO also contained a clause that asked for the capture of passengers’ biometric data to be expedited. 

	Pinkerton noted that airlines were being made responsible for the collection of the biometric data and its associated costs.

	“That should be a government function,” she said. “It is security and should be handled by the federal government.”


don't like EO, interesting asked to gather biometric data

	There had been some debate whether green card holders should be even allowed to board international flights. It was decided by the Department of Homeland Security they could fly to the US and would be considered on a case-by-case basis after passing a secondary screening.

	But the guidance sent to airlines on Friday night, obtained by CNN, said clearly, "lawful permanent residents are not included and may continue to travel to the USA." 

	As of Saturday afternoon, Customs and Border Protection continued to issue the same guidance to airlines as it did Friday, telling airlines that fly to the US that green card holders can board planes to the US but they may get extra scrutiny on arrival, according to an airline official.


CNN says arlines told to allow LPRs

	Kevin McAleenan, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, said Tuesday that in some cases, airlines "overinterpreted our guidance" on which visa holders should be stopped from boarding U.S.-bound flights. 


I think McAleenan is saying airlines barred more travelers than CBP told them to


http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/trump-immigration-ban/
	Affected travelers had varying experiences at different airports, according to nearly 200 accounts gathered by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA).

	Many holding visas told the association they were allowed into the country without a problem despite Trump’s executive order banning them.

	But some lawful permanent residents—those with so-called green cards—were turned away despite guidance to airlines from the CBP that they should be allowed to travel.


According to media, john Doe court doc, some LPRs turned away despite CBP guidance (why?)


	...Conflicting media and government reports caused confusion for airlines struggling to deal with the order.

	CBP informed air carriers about the executive order in a conference call late on Friday, said a person familiar with the agency’s communications. CBP then sent written guidance before noon on Saturday saying that green card holders were “not included” in the ban and could continue to travel to the United States. The source said airlines were allowing travelers with green cards on flights until told otherwise.

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/02/trump_is_violating_the_court_orders_against_his_muslim_ban.html
	On Wednesday afternoon, I called the security department at Qatar Airways to try to determine what it had been instructed to do by Trump\u2019s Customs and Border Protection agency. (I made multiple phone calls and sent multiple emails to Jaime Ruiz, a public information officer for CBP. His phone mailbox was full, and he has not returned my emails.) The lawyer who filed the Los Angeles suit, Julie Goldberg, told me in a phone call from Djibouti that she had been attempting to put her clients\u2014who following the Massachusetts order should have been allowed to fly to Boston\u2014on flights to Logan. They had been turned away en masse. That first court order, you\u2019ll recall, explicitly instructs the administration to tell airlines that they need to let people on these flights. As of Monday morning, well after the order, Qatar Airways\u2014which flies from Djibouti, where hundreds of Yemenis are trapped, to Boston via Doha\u2014was not letting her clients board those planes. The security agency had told her its latest update from CBP had come Monday morning and had not added the travelers covered under the Boston order. On Wednesday, when I called the security department of Qatar Airways\u2014the department at that airline that receives and carries out instructions from CBP on who is and isn\u2019t allowed to board flights\u2014I learned that the policy still hadn\u2019t been updated, even after the Los Angeles court order and its instructions to \u201cimmediately\u201d notify relevant authorities that some of these passengers were allowed to travel. When I gave a man who identified himself as Hamdi a couple of the names listed in that Los Angeles order, he told me he couldn\u2019t find them.


Agrees with what DHS OIG investigation found, that court orders violated overseas

CBP sent update to Qatar airlines Monday morning without new guidance conforming to court order, according to Slate

	CAIRO (Reuters) - Airlines operating at Cairo airport were officially requested on Sunday to prevent U.S. immigration visa holders from seven Muslim-majority countries from boarding flights to the United States, Hossam Hussein, an EgyptAir official, said.

	Hussein, who is responsible for EgyptAir’s daily flight to New York, said authorities there had notified them hours earlier of the new restrictions. He said green card holders from Sudan, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia and Libya would be allowed to board as would holders of diplomatic passports or government officials.

doc on system for Canada


I think it's saying they have to give Canadian border officials "advanced passenger info" for each passenger, then officials can send back a "no board"


http://www.osce.org/secretariat/308796?download=true
	An API system is an electronic communications system that collects biographic data from a passenger’s passport and basic flight details provided by airline operators. Airline communication networks then transmit the data to border control agencies in the destination country or country of origin.Once transmitted, the data are then, in practice, checked by the relevant control agencies against various sanctions lists and watch lists used for immigration, customs and security purposes.

	API systems vary significantly in complexity, depending on costs, technical specifications and level of security. In this regard, they may be divided into two distinct categories: non-interactive batch-style API systems and interactive API(iAPI)systems.

	On the one hand, in abatch-style API system, an airline operator provides the requesting authoritieswith an API message in a batch-styletransmission,meaning dataforall passengers on a particular flight are communicated together, after the flight has closed. On the other hand, an interactive API system (iAPI)transmits the API message on a per-person basis to the requesting authoritiesusing real-time communication, thereby giving national authorities the opportunity to issue a board/no-board advisory message to the airline operator.Essentially iAPI is processed per passenger at the time of check-in. 

	...The main contribution of API systems to border management is that details of arriving/departingpassengers are received prior to the arrival of the flight, in the case ofbatch API, and prior to departure in the case of iAPI.  Thus,  law  enforcement  officials  can  know  in  advance  whether  potential  or  known  offenders  or inadmissible persons are travelling. This not only provides border control authorities with adequate time toutilize their resources more efficiently, but also helps to reduce their workload through the use of technology and automated means.


so for some systems, get API data before departure and can reply with "board/no board"

says u.s. has iAPI

"Airlines are informed that CBP will process all individuals arriving at Logon Aiport in accordance with the law. Upon arrival at Logan International Airport all individuals will be processed in accordance with the law, incluiding to determine if they are inadmissible. ... Carriers are reminded that it is unlawful to bring into the United States any alien who does not have a valid passport and an unexpired visa, if a visa was required under the Act or regulations issued thereunder."

https://www.cbp.gov/travel/travel-industry-personnel/carrier-liaison-prog
	The Carrier Liaison Program (CLP) was developed to enhance border security by helping commercial carriers to become more effective in identifying improperly documented passengers destined to the United States. The primary method for accomplishing this mission is by providing technical assistance and training to carrier staff. Technical assistance includes publication and distribution of information guides to carrier staff worldwide. In addition, CBP developed the 24/7 Regional Carrier Liaison Group phone center to provide real-time entry requirements and document validity advice to the carriers worldwide.

CLP wasn't sending out guidline bulletins as of Jan 30. Some carriers like Korean Air not included in the giant email updates.

So they call some carriers to tell them CLP will update them, then CLP doesn't put out any bulletins, then they tell airlines to call someone instead (I guess person at CLP).

I guess only official guidance was the giant emails they were sendingn out to carriers?

interesting CNN did not report this... says chaos in CBP, they did have a crisis action team, but real chaos apparently with the airlines and interacting with CBP


	The confusion and subsequent critical response from DHS stemmed from the fact that Homeland Security officials didn't see the president's travel restrictions until he signed the executive order on January 27, one week into his presidency. The DHS crisis action team is used to coordinate communications and actions during massive incidents that involve federal, state, local, and private sector groups. 


but related to Trump not informing them


Kelly and Kevin say CBP did good job scrambling to implement EO, and maybe did all things considered. Yet airlines confused--was this forseeable?
