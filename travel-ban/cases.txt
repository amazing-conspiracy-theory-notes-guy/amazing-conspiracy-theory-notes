	Will Gupta aches to visit his parents in northern India near the border with Pakistan.

	But he can’t bring himself to do it. Not yet.

	It has nothing to do with his legal status. He’s a legal permanent U.S. resident. But the 32-year-old East Los Angeles resident worries that his appearance, combined with the fact that he’s not yet an American citizen, could cause him to be flagged somehow.

	Gupta moved to California more than a decade ago to work at a friend's garment business and later got a green card.

	He can travel back to his homeland. But he said the Trump administration is so unpredictable that he believes it “can enact any law just like that. There’s no advance warning. He just signs a piece of paper and your life can change.”

	So, worried that his return would somehow become complicated, he has no plans to travel overseas any time soon.

	Gupta said he will board a flight to visit his mother and father when he thinks he finally understands “the new way the U.S. operates.”

	For some legal residents, traveling in a time in which talk of travel bans and massive border walls flows from the White House has become an anxiety-inducing proposition.

	The complaint alleged that on Jan. 28, 2017, a gate operator at the Frankfurt airport, who introduced himself as a representative from the consulate of the United States, told the plaintiff that she was ineligible to board a flight to the United States pursuant to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on Jan. 27, 2017 (suspending entry into the United States of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen). The complaint further alleged that when the plaintiff returned to the Frankfort airport on Jan. 31, with a copy of the Jan. 29 Temporary Restraining Order issued in Louhghalem/Tootkaboni v. Trump providing immediate protection to "holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas ... who, absent the Executive Order, would be legally authorized to enter the United States," the plaintiff was once again prevented from boarding her flight to Boston, despite being subject to the TRO's protection as a valid J-1 visa holder.

	LOS ANGELES — Soon after Hossein Vayghan arrived at Los Angeles International Airport, he bought a bouquet of roses to hand to his brother, Ali Vayeghan, who was scheduled to arrive from Tehran just after 7 p.m. on Friday, with his green card in hand.

	...The brothers communicated occasionally by phone and text, and Mr. Vayeghan said he had not been given any food to eat or a place to sleep. Federal officers were pressuring him to a sign a document withdrawing his green card, he said, telling him he could be permanently banned from the United States if he did not. After hours of refusal, Mr. Vayeghan gave in, unsure of what exactly he was signing. Soon after, the authorities tried to get him to board a plane to Dubai, but Mr. Vayeghan hesitated. The agents soon picked him up to force him onto the plane, he later told his family.

When he landed at Los Angeles International Airport on the evening the executive order was issued, U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained him and threatened to deport him back to Iran as soon as the next day. Had he been granted admission to the U.S., he was to receive a green card seven weeks later. While detained at the airport, the plaintiff was denied access to counsel.

	Subject: Today's offload incident

	Jan 2 12:50:43 PM

	...Peter as you know a serious incident happened today and as air carrier ; upon the request from cpb side, we had to offload about 40 passenger although they were not at the no fly list. Bearing in mind that we couldn't provide any logical explanation to those passenger and considering the customer satisfaction , we need an announcement to justify our today's act. So I kindly request any related document to be shared with us.



footer says this is from Turkish airlines


Peter Alexander forwards this to Jessica Brigantty saying Turkish, other airlines reported major delays due to offloads and asks for guidance from "you folks."


later, 1:25 PM, Peter emails a bunch of people on same subject:


	All- Follow-up

	I reached out to AME CBP APIS Manager and here's her response.

	Thanks,

	Peter


	[REDACTED Referred to Another Agency/Component]



APIS is system for sending "no board" messages to airlines

could be they were offloaded for that reason? Why is this redacted?


whatever happened in "offload incidnet" Turkish airlines apparently thought it was hard to explain, and wanted something from CBP

Peter at CBP apparently thought the APIS Manager would be best to explain it, and sent whatever she said to a bunch of other people

	Green card holders offloaded at Dubai airport due to US entry ban

	Following US President Donald Trump’s US travel entry ban against seven Muslim-majority countries, passengers flying via Dubai en route to US said they were stopped by Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an arm of US Homeland Security.

	...In one reported case, Nazanin, a woman visiting her mother in Tehran, reportedly wrote on Facebook that she was removed from an Emirates plane in Dubai bound for Washington even though she has a green card allowing her to work and live in the United States.

	Another passenger wrote on his Twitter account that people were stranded in the airport including a couple who left two daughters, seven and nine, at home in America, “with their neighbor for a quick trip to attend a funeral. Green card holders for 11 years … Another man went to meet his future in-laws in Turkey and now can’t get back. [A] PhD student.”

	A friend of Ahmed T. El-Gaili met the Iraqi couple while in transit at Dubai International Airport. 

	"Now they are stranded and can't get back to the US. They left their two daughters aged 7 and 9 with their neighbor for quick trip to attend a funeral. Green card holders for 11 years," Gaili writes.

	Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, said that Trump’s executive order did not cover special immigrant visas, but in the confusion that followed his order, Banah was not permitted to board a Turkish Airlines flight last week. She was traveling separately from her family because her parents and sisters had a deadline to leave Iraq and she didn’t receive her visa in time to board the plane with them. While the rest of her family left before Trump’s executive orders, by the time Banah attempted to board a plane last weekend, the order had slammed the door on immigrants traveling to the United States from the seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/03/trump-travel-ban-dubai-airline
	Turning people away was heart-wrenching; my colleagues and I were in disbelief. For instance, one Syrian woman with a green card – who had lived in the US for decades – was turned away due to the order. We also couldn’t send her to 95% of our destinations as she holds a Syrian passport, which left her stuck in the airport for 48 hours – even Dubai does not allow Syrians to enter without a visa.


airport worker implies she turned away green card holder

good enough?


	...Usually, airlines use a system called Timatic to determine if a passenger has the necessary documentation to fly to their destination. Timatic was not updated to reflect the executive order, as the US government failed to notify the International Air Transport Association, which operates the database, about the changes. This created a lottery system where passengers’ fates were decided on the fly.

	Whenever we came across someone who may potentially be banned under the order, we contacted the US Customs and Border Protection and put in a more informal call to the airport the person was destined for to ensure they’d be granted entry. Some airports said yes, others said no, while some depended on what time and who was on duty. The mood of security officials in Dubai also [was] a factor.


says at first computer system for checking documentation for people trying to fly not updated, and had to call in for people who might be affected by the EO. Says it was pretty random and depended on who was on duty, mood.


	...By Sunday afternoon, the process became more formalized, where anybody with a nationality from one of these countries was flagged instantly and taken for additional screening. Green card holders were from then on allowed to board, but it’s my guess that any other visa holders will be denied. 


more formal by Sunday afternoon, green card holders allowed to board after this




http://www.france24.com/en/20170129-trump-muslim-ban-immigration-lawyer-usa
	In the general confusion after the ban was signed, there were reports that some green card holders of Iranian nationality were not being allowed to board US-bound flights in Frankfurt (as well as in Amsterdam and Tehran and several other cities).

	The child is staying in a rented room in Djibouti with her Yemeni grandfather, Molhi told the AP from his home in San Francisco, where he works as an Uber driver. He has not yet seen her in person, and his wife has not seen her since she was a month and a half old.

for doe v. Trump "ticketing agency" denied selling him a ticket--different from most other cases, where when details given (like visas) people denied boarding or taken off plane


dunno if they'd check things like no fly list at ticket sale time, especially since that can change

for example: can have visa pending when you buy a ticket, visa ready a few months later when you fly. Might be common case actually for new immigrants.

Most tickets bought electronically. But I guess he went to travel agency?

If guidance to airlines bad, can't imagine what was said to travel agency. So possible they hear of EO and decide they can't sell this guy a ticket.

	BOSTON —

	Massachusetts is feeling the effects of President Donald Trump’s executive order that is preventing foreigners from predominately Muslim countries from entering the United States.

	The New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said its aware of six Iranians with work and student visas who were prevented from traveling to Boston Saturday, as well as six Iraqi families now stuck in Egypt.

	"These people are scholars. They are scientists," Susan Church said. "Lawful permanent residents who have been through numerous security background checks, interviews, re-interviews. Some people waited two or three years to obtain their green card."

	Church told WCVB a person made it to Logan International Airport in Boston from Frankfurt, but was sent back on a plane and another individual was barred at Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
