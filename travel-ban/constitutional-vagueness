	Unconstitutional vagueness is a three-legged doctrine. Courts throw out statutes they can’t understand because, first, if a judge can’t understand it then God help the citizen who is trying not to break it; second, if the language is loose then cops and prosecutors can pick and choose cases on arbitrary, and possibly discriminatory, grounds;


hmmm

	and, third and probably most important, if courts have to struggle with the language then the legislature has shifted its work—writing the law—to the judiciary, in violation of the separation of powers. The last leg is probably the most important to the Court; the reargument is a sign that, since Congress has done nothing despite repeated urgings, at least four members of the Court are ready to strike down the clause altogether.


courts didn't like idea of rewriting EO either

	) A constitutional rule that requires criminal laws to state explicitly and definitely what conduct is punishable.  Criminal laws that violate this requirement are said to be void for vagueness.  Vagueness doctrine rests on the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.  By requiring fair notice of what is punishable and what is not, vagueness doctrine also helps prevent arbitrary enforcement of the laws.


only for criminal laws?
