	A U.S. federal law enforcement official says any non-U.S. citizen from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen is now barred from entering the United States.

	That covers legal permanent residents — green card holders — and visa-holders from those seven countries who are out of the United States after Friday, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the temporary ban. They cannot return to the U.S. for 90 days.

	The official says there’s an exemption for immigrants and legal permanent residents whose entry is in the U.S. national interest, but it’s unclear how that exemption will be applied.


https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-travel-ban-could-affect-green-card-holders-officials-say/
	Senior administration officials told CBS News Saturday that for permanent American residents -- those holding green cards -- from the listed countries, their readmittance to the U.S. will be done on a “case by case exemption process.”

	...According to one administration official, for those people who are currently overseas and want to re-enter the U.S., they will be processed by the same waiver process that addressed, for example, the individuals detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport Saturday.

	Of that incident, which involved Iraqi immigrant Hameed Darweesh, the official said it “demonstrates that the exemptions and waivers process that we put into place is already working exactly as intended.” (Darweesh, who had been issued a visa to the country, was freed after two U.S. lawmakers -- Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats of New York -- appeared at the airport asking about his detention.)

	'Case by case' approach for U.S. green card holders under Trump's new order

	U.S. green card holders from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries traveling outside the United States need to check with a U.S. consulate to see whether they can return, senior U.S. administration officials said on Saturday.

	New restrictions on immigrants and refugees in an executive order signed by President Donald Trump will mean legal permanent residents who have passports from the seven countries have to be cleared back into the United States on a case-by-case basis, an official told reports in a briefing.

	"It's being cleared on a case-by-case basis and being moved expeditiously," the official said.

	Green card holders will need additional screening: White House

	U.S. green card holders will require additional screening before they can return to the United States, the White House said on Saturday.

	Earlier, a Department of Homeland Security official said people holding green cards, making them legal permanent U.S. residents, were included in President Donald Trump's executive action temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.

	"It will bar green card holders," Gillian Christensen, acting Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in an email.

	A senior White House official later sought to clarify the situation, saying green card holders who had left the United States and wanted to return would have to visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to undergo additional screening.

	"You will be allowed to re-enter the United States pending a routine rescreening," the official said.

	Green Card Holders Fall Under Trump's Executive Order

	Green card holders, who are legal residents of the United States, fall under President Trump's executive order on immigration if they come from any of the seven Muslim-dominated countries from which immigration is temporarily banned, according to a senior administration official who spoke to ABC News.

	People from these countries who hold green cards to live in the U.S. but who are currently outside of the country will need a waiver to re-enter the United States. The waivers will be issued on a case-by-case basis, the official told ABC News.

	Green card holders currently in the U.S., who hail from any of the seven countries listed in Trump's order, will need approval before leaving the country or risk being detained while re-entering the country, the official said.

	...As to people with green cards who are currently traveling or "in transit" back to the United States, the official said that the order has a hardship exemption. The official said administrators are still working out how to define "in transit" and "hardship."

	The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department are currently finalizing guidance that will be issued to airports and airlines regarding implementation of the order, the official added.

	...The official also said that the Trump team has been working on the order for "weeks," starting during the transition period.

	Green card holders from Trump-restricted countries may not be allowed into US

	The US government will not automatically allow green card holders who traveled to countries placed under a temporary travel ban back into the United States, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.

	Instead, those travelers will have to apply for a waiver to the executive order that instituted the ban, the sources said. When they land, they will be taken into a secondary screening process to determine their eligibility.

	...Green card holders already overseas seeking to return to their homes in the US will be processed through a waiver authority that has already been established.

	One official said there is a case-by-case admissions process and another said it is being done "expeditiously."

	People from the seven countries who have green cards -- a government document granting permanent residence in the US -- should not leave the country because they may not be allowed back in the US, one source familiar with the matter said.

	...Those traveling without a green card who landed in the United States after the order was signed would be detained and put back on a flight to their country of citizenship, an administration official told CNN.

	Separately, Department of Homeland Security officials acknowledged people whonhz were in the air would be detained upon arrival and put back on a plane to their home country. A couple dozen people were held overnight at US airports, an official familiar with the matter told CNN.

	11 p.m.

	Foreign-born U.S. residents who could have been barred from re-entering the United States under President Donald Trump’s immigration order have been allowed back into the country.

	That’s according to a Department of Homeland Security official who briefed reporters on Saturday night. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn’t authorized to publicly discuss details of the matter.

	Trump’s order Friday barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States for 90 days. That meant that even those with permanent residency “green cards” or other visas risked not being let back in to the United States.

	However, the official said all green card holders from the seven countries who sought to enter the U.S. Saturday were granted special permission.

	It’s not clear if other green card holders will be admitted. The official said cases are being reviewed individually.

"expeditious" waiver process not expeditious enough?

Media reports say DHS still "developing" how waiver process works as of Saturday. According to DHS FAQ on ban on Feb 2, "senior personnel" have to review "individual cases:"

https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2017-Feb/EO-QA-PDF-WEB-02.02.2017.pdf
	4. What do the two exemptions in the Executive Order mean? How are they applied to individual cases?

	DHS and State can review individual cases and grant waivers on a case-by-case basis if that individual’s admission to the United States is deemed to be in the national interest and if they do not pose a national security threat.

	5. What is the process for considering an individual for an exemption under the Executive Order?

	Senior DHS personnel can review individual cases and grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis if that individual’s admission to the United States falls within the parameters of the Executive Order. CBP is processing exemptions consistent with the Secretary’s guidance.


says this on green card holders:

	8. Does this Executive Order apply to  green card holders from one of the seven  countries listed?

	Under the recent guidance from the White House, we will continue to ensure that lawful  permanent residents are processed through our borders efficiently. Under that guidance,  the Executive Order issued January 27, 2017, does not apply to their entry to the United  States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection will continue to execute its mission to protect  the homeland in its processing of all individuals at ports of entry.  

	9. Will nationals of restricted countries with valid green cards (LPRs) be allowed to  return to the United States?

	Under the recent guidance from the White House,  CBP will continue to ensure that  L PRs are processed through our borders efficiently.  Under that guidance, the Executive Order  entitled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States” does  not apply to  LPRs’  entry to the United States.  Prior to this guidance, a nd as o f February  1 , 2017 , CBP processed 1,610 waivers for LPRs to re - enter the United States. 

	10. How many Lawful Permanent Residents have not been allowed to enter pursuant to  the exception to the Executive Order?

	Two. One, who was entered into proceedings based on a criminal record.  Another  individual chose to return to Canada and withdrew their request for entry.


says EO "does not apply" to LPRs, pretty sure citing McGahn memo. Says before McGahn memo, process LPRs under waivers (1,610 of them). Says exactly two LPRs denied entry because of waiver process. One because of criminal record, another who voluntary withdrew "request for entry."

next Q says withdrawals of green cards voluntary.

15 says F1/J1/M1 visas cancelled, those outside U.S. out of luck.

16 dodgy on the religious interivew thing

so unless something strange going on with the two denied waivers, any LPR not let would either:

- be turned away outside u.s.

- never started waiver process in first place and detained or removed

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/29/unnamed-white-house-official-on-implementing-travel-ban-it-really-is-a-massive-success-story/
	There had been some confusion about how legal permanent residents — also known as green-card holders — would be treated under this new order. On Saturday, this same senior administration official told reporters that if a green-card holder from one the seven targeted countries is currently elsewhere in the world, that person would need to apply for a case-by-case waiver before returning to the United States. But then on Sunday morning, the president's chief of staff went onto a morning news show and said that the executive order “doesn’t affect them.”

	“Nothing has changed,” the senior administration official explained, claiming that the White House has provided clear instructions from the beginning on how green-card holders should navigate the system. These green-card holders are “exempt” from the new restrictions, the senior administration official said.

	A reporter jumped in: “That's different from what you said when we were in here yesterday, right?”

	“No,” the senior administration official said.

	“Do you want me to pull the quote?” the reporter said.

	“You can do whatever you want,” the official said.

	The official then explained that green-card holders are exempt because they can apply for and receive a waiver. As of Sunday afternoon, 170 legal permanent residents had applied for waivers to avoid the new restrictions and all 170 had been granted those waivers.

	“Some of the confusion stemming from the green-card issue is just semantic in nature,” the senior administration official said. “I think some of the confusion stems from the semantic debate about the meaning of the word 'exemption.' Again, internally, we've been clear on this from the beginning, and we've waived people through.”

	In an apparent indication that Mr Kelly's instructions were being implemented, some green card holders arriving in the US said they had no trouble clearing customs.

	All green card holders who were detained at US airports had been admitted into the country by late Sunday (local time), a US official familiar with the process told Reuters.

	Friday night, DHS arrived at the legal interpretation that the executive order restrictions applying to seven countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen -- did not apply to people with lawful permanent residence, generally referred to as green card holders.

	The White House overruled that guidance overnight, according to officials familiar with the rollout. That order came from the President's inner circle, led by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon. Their decision held that, on a case by case basis, DHS could allow green card holders to enter the US.


https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-30/airlines-scramble-to-adjust-to-trump-s-new-world
	On Sunday, the Trump administration slightly loosened the restrictions for those with long-term U.S. resident status, saying those travelers would be admitted subject to “case-by-case determinations.”

	“When you’re an LTR (long-term resident) you present your passport, you present your green card and they say ‘Welcome home,’” Bolour said. “That’s what’s supposed to happen.”

	As Trump's sudden move Friday set off a frenzy at airports around the world, the couple's attorneys advised Haghighi to skip her original flight in case customs officials seized her passport or barred her from boarding.

	...Culley is working frantically with his attorneys to rebook Haghighi's flight back, which was originally set to arrive Monday in Houston.

	The attorneys were worried about her landing in Houston, which doesn't fall in any federal districts where stays were ordered. Her attorneys denied an interview request for this story but are attempting to book her on a flight that arrives in New York, Boston or Chicago, Culley said.


apparently, at that point could have boarded a flight and got a waiver

doesn't say she ever tried, says attorney's advised her to skip her original flight.

seems like they did a lot to shift away blame if any LPR got denied travel due to the EO

if someone denied ticket, maybe could chalk up to computer problems at Delta?

gave out waivers to sign away LPR status, and apparently the LPRs that are well known who were detained signed these first. So could argue in court they didn't actually break law there--they weren't LPRs anymore.

https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3914492-EO-FOIA-CBP-Set-1.html#document/p11/a367087

looks like CBP guidance


says order applies to "returning resident aliens", but says they should be detained until they can get a waiver. Also says refugees should be held until "excemption obtained."


also says "CBP officers are instructed to take the following actions" for aliens "subject to the executive order" who "arrive at the port of entry:"


1. case process recorded in [redacted] system
2. "Subjects will be allowed to withdraw their application for admission on Form I-275 *without a sworn statement*.
3. "Should the alien decline to withdraw their application for admission, the alien will be placed in Expediated Removal in accordance with standard operating procedures"
4. "Aliens claiming fear of return will be referred to an asylum officer, and processed for Expeiated Removal/Credible Fear (ERF). Aliens processed under ERF procudures will be referred to ERO for detention. ..."


no date on document

I guess this is where they got the idea to coerce detainees into signing away their admission. It doesn't say explicitly that this "guidance" shouldn't apply to LPRs.


intercept says this arrived "in the middle of the night" Friday night I think

kindof confusing

references DHS kelly statement, so this some time after Sunday

I guess this continues to make it confusing whether or not LPRs should be detained, and what those with authority have to do to grant a waiver

they never got trained or much guidance on how to grant waivers--do they have to try to find "derogatory information" on LPRs before letting them in?

I guess from guidance seen so far they would take them into secondary screening then decide based on that whether or not to let them in

"dispositive" means "clearly settles an issue" as a legal term. So this guidance I think says LPRs should be let in, or that being LPR is very strong evidence that they should be given waiver.

says they are using the waiver system for the people detained who were in flight when EO signed

guidance is refer them for a "[redacted] examination," then if no "derogatory information" exists, refer for "consideration for a waiver" under EO. "If derogatory information is discovered during the examination, the case should be referred to up the chain to determine appropriate next steps."


this might be some not released until later--would be putting these people into investigations, and going up the chain for "guidance" based on what they found

would end up that those with the most "derogatory information" would otherwise have the strongest case

"Good. These are the members in focus and the ones for which we need to know what [redacted] outlined at the bottom of this string. The number of Approved, Conditionally Approved, Pending. The number who are US LPRs, Canadian LPRs, and the number who are non LPR SENTRI members. Thanks."


later Jan 31:

"We are running the list of 579 from last night, it isn't clear if all fall into scope of the EA. We need to make sure there are no gaps, so we need the following additional data runs to cross check"



why did they want this?

SENTRI is some kind of customs fast-pass system

Subject: Clarification on Executive ORder: urgent request.

"We have just been provided guidance that US LPRs are not subject to the Executive order issued on 1/27/2017. In the past 2 days, we have manually revoked, denied, or failed risk on hundreds in this category."


"Customs and Border Protection
Admissibility and Passenger Programs"


hmmmm


CBP leadership keeps saying they don't know what's going on in their system with visa revocation, but this guy says they "manually revoked" hundreds of LPRs "in past 2 days." How did that happen?

J. Ryan Hutton was supposed to be "Deputy Executive Director" of "Admissibility and Passenger Programs."

Tod Hoffman was supposed to "Executive Director"

the state dept memo "provisionally revoked" visas according to EO (pg 17 here: https://foiarr.cbp.gov/streamingWord.asp?i=1530). Did they just take that memo and manually enter it into their system? wouldn't work for people auto-denied boarding since they would never get to waiver process in the first place.



followup:, Feb 1 2 PM

"Any feedback on this request? We may need to reinstate these all TODAY, and need to know as soon as possible whether this can be done with an OIT assist or if we must do it all manually ( again)."


scrambling to undo in response to McGahn memo?


...


https://foiarr.cbp.gov/streamingWord.asp?i=1598

Feb 6 apparently still working on reinstating people in GES, or finishing up, or just getting list of who was revoked

pg 16

has list of GES revoked, reinstated

some reasons:

"Following additional guidance on the Executive Order, US LPRs reinstated"

about 7 with that status, enacted apparently on Feb 3 2017



...

pg 1


"Go ahead and send the lists as soon asa you get them. Err on the side of reinstatement as long as it appears on list we revoked."

So much for Trump's ideas of "national security"

has sone numbers on how EO affected people

and also a letter from ACLU and affidavits?

dunno what this FOIA request was...


pg 64

a letter about people being tricked into signing away admission, on media reports

maybe this FOIA on that


Aziz petition in there

a "Fact Sheet" on EO from DHS press office, dated Jan 29


pg 99 "Importantly, however, lawful permanent residents of the United States traveling on a valid I-551 will be allowed to board U.S. bound aircraft and will be assessed for exceptions at arrival ports of entry, as appropriate. The entry of these individuals, subject to national security checks, is in the national interest. Therefore, we expect swift entry for these individuals."


Except they denied their visas... not so swift entry then

detaining and getting them to sign away LPR status not so swift entry either, which is apparently what this FOIA request was about.

Jan 30 email to "enforcement division"

subject: media queries


"Lawul Permanent Residents

1. Note - I know that there was a release issued yesterday stating that Sec Kelly deems the admission of lawful permanent residents (green card holders) to be in the national interest. However, from the release, it seems that this is only considered as a positive factor, rather than a decisive one, and that all cases are being considered on a case-by-case basis. Is that normal?

Kevin to Gene Hamilton, other WH ppl on Jan 27 8 PM

"Was it your understanding that the EO was intended to apply to returning LPRs? [REDACTED]. Let me know. Thanks"

Gene to Kevin cc other WH ppl

"They should generally be proved the case-by-case exemption under 3(g), provided that it is in the national interest to do so (i.e. provided that there is no security risk being posed, meaning that there should be a revetting of sorts)."


Kevin to Gene, other WH ppl

"Adding CoS,

Gene,
Understood. We want to faithfully and quickly execute the EO, but want everyone to know that this guidance changes our status.

[REDACTED]. The 175 travelers a day average was for non-immigrant visa holders and non-LPR immigrant visas.

It will be more like 600-800 a day including LPRs. We have 300 in the air inbound right now. And of course, they are revetted in a way to board the aircraft and re-enter the country.

We will keep working up operational impact, but wanted to flag this as our understanding has changed."


reply form Kirstjen Neilsen

"[REDACTED] please draft an email update for the Secretary. I would rather not call him this late- but will have his mil aide direct him to the mail.

I believe this will be news to him."


Kirstjen thinks it will be news to Kelly (if I read right) that EO applies to LPRs.


where, when did it happen (if happened) that DHS told WH they did legal review and found didn't (or couldn't?) apply to LPRs?

Kevin is just like "oh ok"

"returning refugees or asylees who are nationals of the seven EO countries are **not** permitted to board."

even though they can grant waivers? I guess really were following literal text of the EO (although did I think tell airlines LPRs could board, at least in emails or calls)

CBP having computer trouble?

pg 22

Todd Hoffman sends to DFOs that EO "includes all non-immigrant classifications" and "also includes all immigrant classes of admission, returning resident aliens refugees and asylees."

then says "Department to State has provided CBP with a letter provisionally reovking all immigrant and non-immigrant visas for nationals of [7 countires]. Reovactions may not yet be annotated in the system.

Whereever possible, [REDACTED] will coordinate the denial of boarding through [REDACTED] locations, and [REDACTED]

Should aliens, subject to the Executive Order, arrive at the port of entry, CBP officers are instructed to take the following actions:"

then lists the guidance for deporting, admission form, LPRs

sounds like Hoffman knew that all subject to the EO would be denied entry?

this sent on Jan 28 1:00 AM

did Hoffman also tell carriers to allow LPRs?

https://foiarr.cbp.gov/streamingWord.asp?i=1597


intercept says these revocations weren't visas, but for "global entry" system:

https://theintercept.com/2017/12/14/global-entry-trump-travel-ban-muslims/
	“We have just been provided guidance that US LPRs [lawful permanent residents] are not subject to the Executive order issued on 1/27/2017,” a CBP staffer wrote in a February 1 email. “In the past 2 days, we have manually revoked, denied or failed risk on hundreds in this category.”


so how did it end up that LPR denied boarding flights?

if not revoking visas, why revoke GES? and scramble after McGahn memo?


http://freetravelguys.com/global-entry/global-entry-clearance-revoked-wont-believe/

this guy says could still board after GES revoked, so guessing it's not effectively like visa revoked


------


clearly not all LPRs got visas revoked--1,600 made it back to U.S.

McAlleenan said something like 600 per day would be procesed?

so a little on the low side

how did it end up that some LPRs could board just fine and some couldn't?

not sure what exactly happens when visa revoked--is it all thorugh AQQ and things like that?


------


EVUS CBP's system for visas

says this:


https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp-evus-august2016.pdf
	EVUS will provide carriers (air travel) with an official determination of an enrollee’s eligibility to travel to the United States through the Advance Passenger Information System Quick Query (APIS/AQQ) Program2 when the carriers initiate an interactive APIS/AQQ query. Visa holders who attempt to enroll but receive an unsuccessful enrollment can make another attempt to enroll of call the CBP call center for further assistance. When a former visa holder’s visa has been revoked and he or she receives the message, “The Department of State has revoked your visa,” he or she will be directed to the DOS to apply for a new visa, if appropriate. EVUSvisa confirmation is a requirement in all ports of entry, not just air. EVUS status will be verified by CBP Officers at land border ports of entry through the EVUS system.


so if visa cancelled in their system, would be communicated to airlines via AQQ

and airlines did see some no board on AQQ and asked about it--CBP officials said the visa cancellations were still processing and brushed it off.





------



how did CBP develop policy of letting in green card holders with the exemption? did they do that on their own?

media reports, exchange between McAleenan and Hamilton suggests they first decided it doesn't apply to green cards at all

Preibus in his interview said "we didn't overrule DHS"

his word isn't worth much

but guessing what happened is DHS first decided it doesn't apply at all to LPRs, then WH said to use the exemption, and Gene Hamilton was privvy to this

a bunch of LPRs coming in from Canada and Mexico put in secondary inspection

makes the "1,600 processed" number seem more off if Kevin right about 600/day (was he talking about air travel only? said "300 in air right now")

actually 1,600 was as of feb 1

so for 3 days 600 * 3 1,800 is pretty close

had to process a lot of returning LPRs, a lot more work for them
