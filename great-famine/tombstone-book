	In order to understand how China descended into catastrophic famine and starvation, it is necessary to understand the “Three Red Banners” of the Chinese Communist Party—the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people’s communes. Serving as the political banners that were to lead the Chinese into communism, they sparked the fanaticism of 1958, and as such can also be considered the direct cause of the Great Famine.

	Yet China’s rulers regarded this source of calamity as a precious treasure. From 1958 until just before the launch of reform in 1978, one’s attitude toward the Three Red Banners was a major criterion for determining loyalty—or lack of same—to the party.

	The “General Line” was shorthand for the “General Line for socialist construction.” It referred to the directive to “go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.”1 The news media spread the message that “speed is the soul of the General Line,” and the Great Leap Forward was the embodiment of that ideal. Conceptually, therefore, the General Line and the Great Leap Forward were one and the same, with the General Line emphasizing guiding ideology and the Great Leap Forward emphasizing action; the Great Leap Forward was action guided by the General Line.


Yang says "three red banners" direct cause of the famine

general line, great leap forward, and people's communes

how did all the policies come together to make starvation?

"speed is the soul of the General Line"--wanted to do it quickly


	...ZHOU ENLAI INITIATES THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST “RASH ADVANCE”

	The term “rash advance” (maojin) that became current at this time referred to proceeding too rapidly without due consideration of actual circumstances and likely consequences. Opposition to rash advance in economic construction first arose in early 1956 and continued until early 1957. The main opponents to rash advance were senior officials in charge of economic affairs in the State Council, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, and Bo Yibo. They later formed the backbone of China’s “pragmatic faction,” and, following the deaths of Mao and Zhou, they became a major force shaping China’s economic policies in the reformist 1980s.


Zhou Enlai, Chen Yun, Li Xiannian, and Bo Yibo were "pragmatic faction" and main opponents to "rash advance"

big question: were each making an honest effort at it, or finding ways to piss Mao off or make him suspicious?

an example might be Fermi's "minority report" added on to Oppenheimers report given to Truman before evaluating "cry baby scientists" assessment on whether or not to build H-bomb

Liu Shaoqi equated being careful with "the conservative route"--did Mao think along these lines?

usually people who are easily manipulated are worried about some great conspiracy to undermine them--something else to look for

New Yorker article says "Apprised of the catastrophe in Xinyang, Mao blamed “counter-revolutionaries” and “ruthless class retaliation” by Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists"


	Fearing attack for right deviationism, all levels of government elevated economic targets from 1955 onward. Capital construction rose precipitously, and the number of projects proliferated, putting enormous pressure on steel and cement production. Provinces and cities added their own projects. Zhou Enlai, who was in charge of State Council work, was sure the plans were impossible, and pointed out the emergence of a “phenomenon of impetuous and rash advance.”10

	After careful consideration, Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, and Li Xiannian, at a planning and finance meeting on February 6, 1956, reduced the capital construction investment for 1957 from 18 billion to 14.7 billion yuan. Even so, the capital construction budget was 68 percent higher than for the year before.11

	During the State Council’s Twenty-fourth Plenum, on February 8 [1956], Zhou said, “It would be very dangerous to rush into projects that … have no basis in reality.” “If the leader becomes too hot-headed, a splash of cold water might clear his mind … Please, everyone, be practical and realistic.”12

	In late April, however, during a Politburo meeting Mao proposed increasing the capital construction budget by 2 billion yuan. Zhou disagreed, but Mao persisted with his own view and adjourned the meeting. Afterward, Zhou went to Mao and said, “As premier, I cannot in good conscience agree with this decision.” This infuriated Mao.

	Starting in May, Zhou began correcting the rash advance. During a full meeting of the State Council on May 11, for example, he suddenly said, “The campaign against conservatism and right deviation … can’t go on forever!”13


says there was a backdrop of fear of being accused of "right deviation"? how did that come about?

did Zhou Enlai start the term "rash advance"?

Zhou and Mao argued over capital construction budget 24th plenum feb 8 1956

previously cut from 18 to 14.7 billion yuan, Mao wanted to increase 2 billion

Mao got "infurated" with him after Zhou told him disagreed after meeting

then during meeting May 11, set "campaign against conservatism and right deviation ... can't go on forever!"

I guess Mao would hate Zhou and think him a "right deviant?" what made him want to increase budget anyway?


	Then, in May 1956, the CCP Central Committee decided that economic development required opposing both conservatism and rash advance. The draft budget that the Ministry of Finance submitted to the Politburo for discussion on June 3 echoed the preference for balance. Presided over by Liu Shaoqi, the Politburo on June 10 approved in principle the draft budget and assigned Mao’s secretary, Hu Qiaomu, to amend it in accordance with the views expressed. The capital construction budget for 1957 was reduced again from 14.7 billion yuan to 14 billion yuan.14


eventually decided on "opposing both conservatism and rash advance", balance


	The CCP Central Committee’s Propaganda Department took charge of drafting a People’s Daily editorial stating that “Impetuous emotion has become a serious problem at present, because it exists … first and foremost among the upper ranks of the leading cadres … no departments wanted to be accused of right-deviating conservatism, and they vied to assign the most aggressive targets to the lower levels, with each level passing an even heavier burden on to the level below, ultimately resulting in an intolerable situation.” Before it was published, the editorial was sent to Mao for approval. He annotated it with four words: “I’m not reading it.”15


CCP propaganda dept getting involved? send Mao report saying "impetious emotion" and fight over targets a problem, Mao says "I'm not reading it"


	While working out the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1957 economic plan, Zhou and others continued to counter rash advance and reduced some excessively high economic targets.16 These moves were reflected upon during the Eighth National Congress of the CCP, convened September 5–27, 1956. Liu Shaoqi’s political report contained two assessments. First, “Our country’s contradiction between the proletariat and the capitalist class has been basically resolved. The millennia-long history of the system of class exploitation has been basically brought to a close, and socialism has been basically established as the social system of our country.” The implication that class struggle had been concluded formed the basis for a new assessment of what constituted China’s main domestic contradiction: “Our country’s main domestic contradiction is the contradiction between the people’s demands to establish an advanced industrial nation and the reality of a backward agricultural nation; it is the contradiction between the needs of the people for the rapid development of the economy and culture, and the present conditions under which the economy and culture cannot satisfy the people’s needs.” In short, economic construction was now the crux of the matter.


Liu Shaoqi choice of words interesting

Mao obsessed with "contradiction" and some weird theory about it (wrote an essay "on contradiction")

Liu get how Mao thinks?

apparently there was a "contradiction" with capitalist class until 1957 but it was now over, and the new "contradiction" was need to solve "backward agricultural nation"


	Zhou Enlai’s report on the Second Five-Year Plan, approved by the Eighth National Party Congress in September, stressed that “the party’s responsibility is to take pains at all times to prevent and correct any tendency toward right-deviating conservatism or left-leaning risk-taking.” The real target was rash advance.

	In a parliamentary system, Mao might have been obliged to resign. In China, however, his paramount position was extremely stable. He was not about to let his subordinates violate his wishes; he would retaliate against the opposition to rash advance when he found the right opportunity.


Zhou sounding smarter, saying "correct any tendency toward right-deviation conservatism or left-leaning risk-taking"

evolution from "right deviation campaign must end" might say something?

	MAO CRITICIZES THE OPPOSITION TO RASH ADVANCE

	A year later, by the second half of 1957, anti-Soviet uprisings in Poland and Hungary had been quelled, and China’s Anti-Rightist Campaign had concluded; the First Five-Year Plan had been completed; and an upsurge in irrigation and water conservancy projects had begun. Mao decided that circumstances were favorable for his counterattack.

	At the Third Enlarged Plenum of the Eighth CCP Central Committee on October 9, 1957, Mao declared:

	Last year several things were swept out. One of the things swept out was “greater, faster, better, and more economical” … everyone was opposed to greater and faster, which some comrades called “rash” … We always need to strive to achieve as much and as quickly as possible, and only oppose the subjective sense of “greater” and “faster.” In the second half of last year, a gust of wind swept out that slogan, and I want to restore it. I want all of you to look into this.

	Also swept out was the Forty-Point Program for Agricultural Development. That forty-point program fell into bad odor last year, and now it will be restored.

	Also swept out were the committees for promoting progress. I have asked in the past whether the nature of the Communist Party … at all levels … is that of promoting or of hindering progress. They should be promoting progress. I see the Kuomintang as a committee for hindering progress and the Communist Party as a committee for promoting progress. The wind that blew up last year swept out the committees for promoting progress, so can we restore them now? If you all disagree with restoring them and insist on organizing a committee for hindering progress, with so many of you preferring hindrance there’s nothing I can do … Those who wish to hinder us are members of that rightist Zhang-Luo Alliance.17

	For Mao to equate those who opposed rash advance with a “committee for hindering progress” and to group them with the Kuomintang and the freshly denounced “rightist Zhang-Luo Alliance” was extremely damaging. Now opposition was tantamount to being a counterrevolutionary.


Mao apparently stewing, upset "some comrades" called his plans (how did he think of them?) "rash"

Mao equated hindering his plans with Koumintang and "rightist Zhang-Lou Alliance"


	Mao also cavalierly overturned the Eighth National Party Congress resolution on China’s principal domestic contradictions, saying:
	
	There can be no doubt that the contradiction between the proletarian class and the bourgeois class, and between the socialist road and the capitalist road, is the principal contradiction our country now faces … We are in the midst of a socialist revolution, and the spearhead of revolution is aimed at the bourgeoisie … It is the There can be no doubt that the contradiction between the proletarian class and the bourgeois class, and between the socialist road and the capitalist road, is the principal contradiction our country now faces … We are in the midst of a socialist revolution, and the spearhead of revolution is aimed at the bourgeoisie … It is the contradiction between the socialist road and the capitalist road. The resolution of the Eighth National Party Congress did not raise this issue. The resolution has one section about the principal contradiction being between an advanced social system and a backward productive force. This formulation is incorrect.18


apparently Mao thought there were still bourgiousie elements to fight

	
	No one resisted. Before Mao spoke, Zhou Enlai had persisted with his position of “opposing conservatism and also opposing rash advance.” Once Mao made his pronouncement, however, all those opposing rash advance held their tongues. Mao’s “comrades-in-arms” were now his submissive subordinates, and his every opinion would be parroted as a golden rule by all those beneath him. In addition, most party cadres were experts in class struggle, and were galvanized by its very mention, spoiling for a fight to prove themselves by targeting dissenters.


after this, everyone under him went along with "rash advance" except Zhou Enlai


	...I spoke twice with comrades Pollitt and Gollan19 and asked them about their country’s situation. They said that the United Kingdom current annual steel production is 20 million tons, and that in fifteen years it may climb to 30 million tons. As for China, in fifteen years, our steel production may be 40 million tons, so why should we not surpass the United Kingdom?”20 Mao imagined that China could produce 40 million tons of steel by 1973, a target met only in the post-Mao reform era. Mao’s grand plan had not been discussed or analyzed at any stage by the CCP Central Committee or the State Council, nor was there any examination by experts. At the Eighth National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on December 2, 1957, President Liu Shaoqi represented the CCP Central Committee with a speech endorsing Mao’s vision, which then became the guiding ideology of the party and the country.


Mao then decides its time to surpass the UK in steel production without talking about it with anyone else and Liu Shaoqi backs him up
