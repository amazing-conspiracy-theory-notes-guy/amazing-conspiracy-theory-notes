Szilard interview

	Published by Little, Brown & Company in 1994, ''Special Tasks'' caused a sensation because of the general's detailed assertions that the Soviet Union had obtained atomic secrets with the aid of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project's laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M., and Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard, three other physicists with central roles in the development of the atomic bomb.


Sudoplatov accused Szilard along with Oppenheimer, Fermi and Bohr

Oppenheimer accusation is dubious--even if her were a spy at one point, seems clear he opposed Soviets and created a lot of trouble for them, and that they opposed him with a "carefully orchestrated takedown" (ad Jogalakar puts it)
